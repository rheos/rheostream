# ADR-0010: The ledger is a function of the document set
Status: accepted
Date: 2026-10-22

## Context

One purchase often reaches the archive several times: a statement PDF, a CSV export of the same
cycle, a transaction download that overlaps two statements and runs past the last one. The copies
word and date the purchase differently. If each import added its lines on top of what the ledger
already held, the result would depend on which file came first, a re-import could double a line,
and a statement arriving after an export could not take over the export's lines. Decisions point at
lines (ADR-0004), so whatever replaces a line has to keep the old reference resolvable.

## Decision

Every derive recomputes all lines from stored parse output (Key decision 4). Nothing about a line
is carried over from an earlier derive; the derived tables are cleared and rebuilt (ADR-0003).

Documents rank per account by control (a tied-out statement, then a running-balance export, then
an unverified export), then format (statement PDF, transaction PDF, CSV, other), then the larger
sha256 (`derive/precedence.py`). Two documents of equal rank for exactly the same periods on every
account they cover, with the same parse output (every line of every kind and every period's
figures), are one document twice: the larger sha256 stays `parsed`, the other becomes
`superseded` in stage 1. Content is compared as well as periods because two exports can state one
period and differ inside it, and two bills of one month can differ in the amount due; superseding
one would drop what it says without a trace, so such a pair is left to the matcher.

Stage 3 (`derive/overlap.py`) then decides each line:

- A tied-out statement owns its period, per currency. Its lines dated inside its period in their
  currency, and outside the periods of statements ranked before it, become txns first. Two
  statements never match each other's lines across a period boundary.
- Every other line matches one to one against txns other documents committed on the account:
  same currency and amount, a posting or transaction date within
  `finance.import.overlap_day_tolerance` of one of the txn's. It prefers the txn its own key
  already names, then an exact date with the same normalized description, then an exact date,
  then the tolerance with the same description, then the tolerance; among equals, the earliest.
  A document's lines take their turn in posting date order, not file order, so an export
  printed newest first cannot hand an older purchase's txn to a newer line. A match is an
  additional `txn_source` and adds no txn.
- An unmatched line becomes a txn outside every tied-out statement period, and a
  `source_discrepancy` (`unmatched_in_statement_window`) inside one.

A line's natural key counts occurrences within its own document, so a document's keys depend on
no other document. An additional source keeps its own line's key: when a covering statement
arrives, a reference taken on a provisional export line resolves through that key to the
statement-backed txn. A line key names one txn; several sources of one txn may share it (a CSV and
a PDF that print a purchase alike). A line whose key names a txn another line of its document
already took is a `source_discrepancy` (`line_key_taken`) rather than a second txn under a key
that is not its own.

A txn's basis is its first document's standing. A txn from an export is provisional when the
account has a tied-out statement in the txn's currency and the txn is dated after the last one
ends.

Derive is single-writer: two derives at once would insert the same derived txn ids, so the
second fails on the txn primary key before the deferred line-key trigger could be outrun.

## Consequences

Import order cannot change the ledger, and a repeat import adds nothing. A wrong match drops a
genuine line, and two unverified exports outside any statement period can still double a line whose
dates differ by more than the tolerance (Technical Risk 1); discrepancies are counted for
`status`, and the tolerance is checked against card overlaps before older years are trusted. An
account with no tied-out statement has no provisional lines, since there is no last statement to
be after.

`finance.ledger.derive` keeps a document's stored parse output when a parse would reproduce it:
the file is still at its path with the document's sha256, and the hash stored with the parse
(`document.parse_inputs`: issuer, format, the id and version of every parser registered for them,
and the whole account registry) is unchanged. A new document, a moved parser version, any registry
change (an account leaving or joining included), or a file that left, was withheld or came back,
is parsed again. Everything after stage 1 is recomputed every run either way.
`finance.ledger.rebuild` registers the archive again and parses every document; it is how a parser
fix that keeps its version, or a new docextract pin, reaches all history. A test holds
derive-after-derive, rebuild-after-derive and derive-after-rebuild to one digest.

`finance.ledger.digest` covers every table a derive clears or rewrites, plus `document` and
`archive_skip`, which the rebuild's archive walk and the parse write. It leaves out the state
tables (`decision`, `decision_item`, `decision_target`), which are inputs, and the columns that
record when a row was written (`document.imported_at`, `sink_spec.computed_at`) or how a parse was
reached (`document.parse_inputs`). A line's or txn's `occurred_at` is data and stays in.

Recorded here because the repo is public and the spec's wording does not fit it, or the build
filled a gap:

- The basis class the spec names after the person is stored as `owner`.
- `txn.cad_source` and `txn.asset_identifier` are tiered restricted, stricter than the spec,
  because the tier guard restricts every name shaped like a CAD figure or an identifier.
- A manual cash line in a currency its account does not take becomes no txn and a
  `manual_entry_error` row (the spec does not say what happens to one).
- 0010's unique index on line keys is replaced in 0011 by a deferred trigger with the same
  intent, so that sources of one txn may share a key.
- Matching first prefers the txn a line's own key already names, ahead of the spec's exact-date
  order. Such a txn is always on the exact date with the same description, so this only breaks
  ties among identical candidates, keeping keys aligned.
- A `line_key_taken` line is a discrepancy even outside every statement period, where the spec
  would make it a txn: its key already names another txn, so it has no key of its own to take.
- Superseding needs identical parse output, not only the identical period the spec names.
- Coverage (stage 6) finds running-balance runs per document. Two exports whose balances
  chain still leave the months at their seam `partial`: this under-reports and never gives a
  false `have`. Chaining runs across documents would need deduplicated lines in date order.
- A month is `have` only when every currency the account lists is verified on every open
  day. The spec says only "every day"; an account that lists a currency it rarely uses will
  show `partial` in months with no verified span in that currency. Revisit if one never
  shows `have`.
- A running-balance break that reaches into a month that is otherwise `partial` gives it the
  reason `running_balance_break`; only months wholly inside a break are `missing` for it.
- `missing_before` names the reason only for months nothing else covers, following stage 6's
  order (its rules come after `partial`), rather than turning covered months `missing`.
