"""No test module or conftest imports a fixture from another module under ``tests/``,
no directory's ``conftest.py`` defines a fixture, and every fixture resolves under any
file order.

A fixture imported from ``test_a.py`` into ``test_b.py`` is registered in both, so
what a test finds rests on what its module imports rather than on its directory.

A fixture in ``tests/derive/conftest.py`` goes missing under one kind of command line.
pytest 9 parses a conftest's fixtures once, for the first collector of its directory,
and a command line that goes into a directory, out and back in
(``tests/derive/a.py tests/b.py tests/derive/c.py``) makes a second collector, which
never gets them: ``c.py`` reports "fixture not found". So every fixture lives in
``tests/conftest.py``, what it builds from lives in a ``support`` module, and a
directory's own ``conftest.py`` defines no fixture.

The static scan parses every ``tests/**/*.py``, collects the functions each decorates
with ``pytest.fixture``, and checks every import of a module under ``tests/``: relative
(``from .test_a``), rooted at ``tests`` (``from tests.derive.test_a``) or at the
``tests`` directory on ``sys.path`` (``from derive.conftest``). Helpers, types and
constants may still be imported.

The order test runs pytest's ``--setup-plan`` in a subprocess, which resolves every
fixture and runs no test and no fixture, over files from three directories, forwards
and backwards, and over a command line that goes back into a directory. It needs no
database.
