"""Derive stage 9: fiat own transfer candidate edges (FR-15, Key decision 9, edge
cases 4 and 5; AC-16 inputs).

Seam: ``derive.run`` through the derive ``ledger`` over synthetic Alder chequing and
Alder Neem exports, read by the real parsers with the repo's transfer wording (and
over ``FX_LINES`` documents for the currency cases), then read back as the
``own_transfer`` rows of ``pair_edge`` and the txns' ``transfer_like`` and
``hint_account_id``. These tests read the candidate set stage 9 stores, not the
``applied`` flag or the derived fee lines: stage 11 makes those
(``test_resolution``). Every date, amount and name is invented; 23.45, 2,345.00 and
234.50 are the spec's own boundary figures.
