"""Receipts and invoices match by the payees' patterns (FR-8, FR-10; Derivation stage 3
"Receipts and invoices").

Seam: ``derive.run`` through the derive ``ledger`` over a synthetic chequing export and
the synthetic patient receipt or invoice, as in ``test_receipts_invoices``, with a
``payees.csv`` or ``accounts.csv`` ``payee_patterns`` that registers one payee under
two printed names: the receipt's (or invoice's) and the payment line's. Every name,
date and amount is invented.
