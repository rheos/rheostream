"""The model seam (FR-47; engineering standards section 14): ``ModelClient``.

A feature asks for a model step with ``call(stage, system, text, schema)`` and gets
back an instance of ``schema`` or an exception; it never sees a process, a reply's
raw text or a provider. ``GuardedModelClient.call`` is the single path every client
takes, in this order:

1. the stage is one of ``STAGES`` (each has its own model setting);
2. the prompt guard checks the system prompt and the text, and a refusal raises
   ``PromptRefused`` before anything is sent;
3. the client's ``_send`` delivers the prompt and returns the raw structured reply;
4. the reply is validated by ``schema``; an invalid reply is discarded and raises
   ``ModelReplyInvalid``, which carries neither the reply nor the validation detail
   (both may echo prompt text).

``StubModelClient`` (tests) is the client here. The production client, over
rheoStream's runtime contract, lands with the module's wiring. There is no SDK and
no API key.
