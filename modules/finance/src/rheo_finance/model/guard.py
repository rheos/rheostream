"""The prompt guard (FR-47; SPEC "Privacy and safety mechanics" > "Prompt guard").

Every model call passes through ``PromptGuard.check`` before anything is sent, the
stub included (``client.GuardedModelClient.call`` is the one caller). The guard
REFUSES a prompt; it never masks one, so what a model sees is exactly what a caller
built, or nothing. A prompt is refused when it holds:

- a phone shape: a North American number with separators, a ``+`` international
  number, or a hyphenated local number (``phone_shape``);
- a 13 to 19 digit card shape (``card_shape``) or any other number of 7 or more
  digits (``digit_run``). Digits joined by runs of whitespace, dots, slashes,
  hyphens or Unicode dashes are one number whatever the grouping (4-4-4-4, 3-3-3,
  two spaces as a layout extract prints them, one digit at a time, across a line
  break), and so is a comma-grouped integer. An ISO date with a real month and day
  and a money amount with cents (comma-grouped, or at most six digits before the
  point) are admitted first, so records of dates and amounts pass;
- a registered account identifier, a party alias, an own or alias address, a recorded
  TXID, or the account holder's name (``identifier``, ``party_alias``, ``address``,
  ``txid``, ``owner_name``): terms a ``TermsProvider`` supplies at check time, so later
  prompts add providers instead of editing the guard;
- an unbroken run of 26 or more letters and digits (``long_token``);
- a binary, PDF or image signature, raw or base64 (``binary``, ``pdf``, ``image``),
  looked for both as given and normalized.

Text is checked after NFKC normalization with every format character and every
default-ignorable code point (zero-width spaces and joiners, variation selectors,
fillers, tag characters) removed, so a fullwidth digit or an invisible break does
not slip a run through. Terms are compared after that, decomposed with combining
marks dropped and casefolded on both sides, so an accented or fullwidth spelling
still matches. A term matches as whole words, or, when it holds 6 or more letters
and digits, anywhere once separators are dropped on both sides. An owner name also
matches by each of its parts of 3 or more letters. Cross-script lookalikes (a
Cyrillic letter for a Latin one) are not folded.

The system prompt and the text are checked alone and joined, so a number, a
signature or a term split across the two is refused too.

A refusal names its class and never the text that tripped it: refusals are counted
and printed, and the text is what must not travel. A provider that cannot read its
terms (a file missing, unreadable or with a row that does not load) refuses every
prompt (``terms_unavailable``): the guard fails closed.
