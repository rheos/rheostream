"""``finance sink approve <sink>``: the one path that records a sink approval (FR-65).

It refuses unless stdin and stdout are both terminals, prints the preview, its digest
and whether the setting is true, reads one typed line that must equal
``approve <sink> <first 8 hex of the preview digest>``, and only then dispatches
``finance.sink.approve`` as the owner, whose handler recomputes the preview and
refuses when the items changed. It never sets the setting.

Only ``cli.main`` imports this module (an import-graph test holds that), so no job,
sink, model step or other module can reach it. The terminal check stops a plain tool
call with no terminal and nothing more; see the repo CLAUDE.md on the real boundary.
``isatty`` and ``read_line`` are injectable so tests can drive it with fake terminals.
