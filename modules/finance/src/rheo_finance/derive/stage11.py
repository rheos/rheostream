"""Derivation stage 11, resolution (core part, fiat): which candidate edges apply, the
transfer states, and the derived fee lines (FR-15, Key decision 9, edge cases 2, 3, 5
and 70).

**The owner's decisions come first** (FR-15, FR-18; ``pair_decisions``, read before
stage 8). The candidate stages already built the graph around them: no edge joining
exactly an ``unpair``'s lines is stored (a loan proposal it names, "not a loan", is
gone, and a line it frees took part in the candidate search as an ordinary line), and
a line a ``pair`` took is an end of its decision's edges only, which the stages stored
even when no ordinary candidate existed. Here each ``pair`` applies its edges (the
target to each other line it names; with no other line, the target's
``own_one_sided`` edge), of any kind, in full: a ``pair`` some edge of which no stage
would store (a mixed fiat and crypto pair, two lines of one sign, a labelled crypto
leg, a one-line pair with no own address, and the rest ``pair_decisions`` lists) is
inert there, so it reaches no stage, takes no line and leaves no edge of its own. A
``pair`` that applies with an edge set no stage stored means the two disagree: stage
11 raises ``DecidedEdgeMissing`` naming the decision, never a bare error.
Every decided edge is ``applied`` with ``basis_ref`` the decision's reference
(``finance.decision:<id>``, the owner's basis), and its lines are ``paired`` with the
edge's kind as ``pair_kind``. Decisions key their lines by line key, so they hold
through a rebuild; one whose key no line carries is the orphan stage's.

**Mutual uniqueness.** On the edges no decision touched, an edge applies only when it
is the only edge on both of its ends, counting the edges of every kind in
``pair_edge`` together, and its kind allows it (``AUTO_KINDS``: ``own_transfer``,
``own_one_sided`` and ``conversion`` today). The spec's stage 11 also auto-applies
``loan_out`` and ``loan_repay``, and ``trade`` when its CAD end qualifies, in this same
pass: Phase 7 adds those kinds to ``AUTO_KINDS`` here, so one count over every kind
keeps uniqueness across kinds. ``loan_partial`` and ``loan_proposal`` never apply on
their own. The result is a function of the decisions and the stored
edge set alone, so it does not depend on the order lines were imported or read.

**States.** On every line that is an end of an edge stage 11 decides:

- an end of an applied edge is ``transfer_state = paired`` with the edge's kind as
  its ``pair_kind``: it adds zero to spending and zero to income;
- any other end is ``ambiguous``, nothing applied (a confirm item);
- a transfer-like line (stage 9) left with no state is ``unresolved``: it has no edge
  of a kind decided here (an original that only a same-day reversal names included).

So each transfer-like line ends in exactly one of {paired, ambiguous, unresolved}.

**Crypto lines** (FR-15(b), edge cases 24, 40 and 77). A crypto line a
``crypto_labels.csv`` row names (``crypto_edges.labelled``; stage 9 left it out of
every pairing) is ``paired`` with ``pair_kind = label``: out of every total and off the
unresolved count. A crypto transfer-like line with no edge ends ``unresolved`` (an
unresolved crypto movement), and each WITHDRAWAL among them (kind
``crypto_transfer``, a negative quantity) raises one ``finance.withdrawal.flagged``
event, dated its posting date, whose data holds the account ref and the line ref only.
A withdrawal an applied ``own_one_sided`` edge pairs is not unresolved, so it raises
none.

**Reversals are settled already.** Stage 8 decides its ``reversal`` edges and their
lines' states. Stage 11 counts those edges (a line with a reversal edge and another
edge has two, so neither applies) but never changes a reversal edge, and a line whose
only edges are reversal edges keeps the state stage 8 gave it. A line stage 8 paired
is never a stage 9 candidate, so its one edge is its reversal edge. A reversal edge
of the owner's ``pair`` is the one stage 11 applies (above).

**Fee lines.** What applied books its fee lines through ``fees.book``: the net of a
decided fiat ``pair`` (with legs, once, leaving an isolated conversion out at its legs'
CAD values, keyed to its first edge that is no such conversion and floored at zero; or
two lines joined by an ``own_transfer``, signed), the net of an applied fiat
``own_transfer`` (signed), and the spread of every applied ``conversion`` but one a
pair with legs fans out (``fees`` holds the rules).
