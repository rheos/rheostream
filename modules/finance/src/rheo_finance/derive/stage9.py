"""Derivation stage 9, fiat own transfers and same-account currency conversions: the
candidate edges (FR-15, FR-15(c), Key decision 9, edge cases 4, 5 and 69).

Stage 9 stores every candidate ``own_transfer`` and ``conversion`` edge in
``pair_edge`` with ``applied`` false; stage 11 decides which apply. On the lines it
reads it also sets ``txn.transfer_like`` and ``txn.hint_account_id``.

**Which lines.** Fiat txns with a nonzero amount, never a line stage 8 paired as a
reversal (``pair_kind = reversal``), an excluded line, or a party line. Reading a line
means reading its primary and additional source lines (never an evidence source, such
as a receipt); a manual cash line, with no document line, has the txn's own wording.

**Transfer-like** (the lines that start a pairing): a source line carries the parser's
``transfer_hint`` or ``conversion_hint``, or its wording matches an ``out``, ``in`` or
``conversion`` row of ``transfer_hints.csv`` (``reference.patterns.row_hints``, the
matching ``classify`` uses). A fee line (``fee_type`` set) never is: a parser prints a
transfer's fee as its own line under the transfer's wording plus "(fee)", and the fee
is spending, not a leg.

**The hint account.** A line's ``hint_account_slug`` names its counterpart in two
ways, told apart by the transfer kind (prompt 29): a built-in pattern's counterpart is
an issuer key of the archive's issuer map, which resolves to every account that lines
of that issuer's documents are on; a ``transfer_hints.csv`` row's (kind ``manual_out``
or ``manual_in``) is the owner's own account slug, which resolves to that account. A
parser's hint wins over a row on the same source line, as in ``classify``, and the
first source line (the primary first) that names a counterpart gives the txn's.
``hint_account_id`` is set when the hint resolves to exactly one account.

**Candidates.** An edge joins a transfer-like line (the start) to a line of the
opposite sign on another account, posted at most ``finance.transfers.window_days``
apart, when:

- the start's hint, when it resolved, is a preference (the search looks on that
  account first): the start's candidates are the lines on the hinted account or
  accounts when any qualifies there, else the lines on every own account. The other
  end's hint is no filter: it acts only when that line is itself a start, so a card
  whose payment wording names one bank still pairs with a payment from another;
- on a card account (kind ``credit_card``, whose parsers mark the payment credits with
  a payment hint) the card-side line is itself transfer-like, so a purchase refund of
  the same amount is never offered as the other leg of a chequing debit;
- a fee line (``fee_type`` set) is neither end: it never starts a pairing (above), and
  it is never the other end either, so a printed fee is never paired away by a small
  transfer-like line of about its size and always counts once as spending;
- a line with a ``conversion`` candidate edge (below), applied or not, is neither
  end: its wording and its one account settle it as a conversion leg, so the in-leg
  of a payment-service currency purchase is never offered to the bank pull that
  funded the purchase, and the pull pairs with the deposit alone;
- the two legs net to zero within the tolerance: the larger of
  ``finance.transfers.fee_tolerance_abs`` (CAD) and ``fee_tolerance_pct`` percent of
  the larger leg's CAD value (stage 4). A pair outside it gets no edge.

**Unconverted legs.** Two legs in one currency compare natively: the net is the sum of
the amounts, and the CAD tolerance is carried into that currency at the larger leg's
own CAD value (exact for CAD). When the larger leg has no CAD value, the percent part
alone applies, since the absolute part is a CAD figure. Legs in two currencies compare
by their CAD values; when either is ``unconverted`` there is no edge, because nothing
can be measured.

**Equal card payments.** For each group of lines the edges connect: when every debit
is a non-card line, every credit a card-side line, all of one amount and currency,
the debits and the credits are the same number (two or more), every debit has every
credit as a candidate (the sets are mutual), and no two debits and no two credits share
a posting date, the edges thin to the date order: the k-th debit by posting date to the
k-th credit. Each kept edge was a candidate, so it lies inside the window. Any other
group keeps every edge. The result depends on the two date-sorted lists only, never on
the order lines were read.

**Conversions** (FR-15(c)). A ``conversion`` edge joins two lines on the SAME account,
opposite in sign, in two currencies, both carrying conversion wording (the parser's
``conversion_hint`` or a ``conversion`` row of ``transfer_hints.csv``; a fee line never
is a leg), posted at most ``finance.conversions.window_days`` apart. ``a_txn_id`` is
the out-leg (the debit), ``b_txn_id`` the in-leg, and the conversion date is the
out-leg's posting date. Lines on two accounts are never a conversion: the
``own_transfer`` rule above handles them, since conversion wording is transfer-like.

- The spread (``spread_cad``) is the out-leg's CAD value (stage 4) minus the in-leg's
  at the stored Rowan rate of the conversion date (a CAD in-leg is its own
  amount). The parsers that print a conversion fee (the money-transfer history and
  statement CSV, the payment-service activity PDF and CSV) emit the out-leg NET of it
  and the fee as its own line, so this spread is already the residual after the
  printed fee; taking the fee off again would count it twice.
- The edge exists only when the spread is inside
  ``finance.conversions.spread_tolerance_pct`` percent of the out-leg's CAD value, in
  either direction (the transfer tolerance is never used here). Outside it there is
  no edge, so the legs end ``unresolved`` unless another edge pairs them.
- With a leg unmeasurable (the out-leg ``unconverted``, or no stored rate for the
  in-leg on the conversion date) the wording settles the pair: the edge is stored with
  no spread, and stage 11 books no fee for it until a rate exists. Every foreign leg
  with no rate stays in the unconverted count meanwhile; a CAD leg is native and never
  unconverted (FR-14), so a CAD to USD conversion with no rate counts one line.
- The issuer's printed fee is a fee line on the account, posted on a leg's date,
  whose wording is a leg's wording plus `` (fee)``, as the parsers print it. Stage 9
  names it (the earliest, when several match) as the edge's ``fee_txn_id``, so stage
  11 books no second fee line for that conversion. Two conversions with the same
  wording on one account and day can name the same line; stage 11 then lets neither
  keep it.

**The owner's decisions** (``pair_decisions``, read before stage 8). No edge joining
exactly an ``unpair``'s two lines is stored, and a line a ``pair`` took is an end of no
edge but its decision's: those are dropped from the candidates before the equal-card
tie-break and before the conversion legs are set aside. When two fiat lines a ``pair``
joins have no candidate edge of any kind (stage 8's included), stage 9 stores one,
whatever the tolerance, the window or the wording say:

- on one account in two currencies, a ``conversion`` (``a_txn_id`` the smaller
  amount, the out-leg) whose spread follows the rule above, with the in-leg's own CAD
  value when no rate is stored for the conversion date, and whose printed fee line is
  named by the rule above;
- otherwise an ``own_transfer`` (``a_txn_id`` the smaller amount, the debit), across
  two accounts or on one account in one currency (a reversal-shaped pair there is
  stage 8's), so stage 11 books the difference as one fee line.
