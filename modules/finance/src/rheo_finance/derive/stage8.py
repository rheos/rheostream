"""Derivation stage 8: reversals, in both directions (FR-15(a), Key decision 9, edge
cases 33, 34, 63 and 81).

**Which lines.** Fiat txns (``movement_kind = fiat``) with a nonzero amount and no
exclusion, as stage 9 reads them: a crypto line or an excluded line is never a
reversal and never the original of one.

**A reversal line** is a txn one of whose lines (its primary or an additional source,
never an evidence source such as a receipt) its parser marked ``reversal_hint`` (the
issuer's reversal wording in ``reference/patterns.json``, read through
``identities.real``), or carries wording a
``reversal`` row of ``transfer_hints.csv`` matches. Its sign is its direction: a
reversal credit undoes a debit (the owner's payment cancelled), a reversal debit undoes
a credit (a received payment clawed back). A line with reversal wording is never
itself the original of another reversal, and a line of the same amount without such
wording is never a reversal: the owner pairs it by decision.

**Its candidates** are the other lines on the same account, in the same currency, of
exactly the opposite amount, posted at most ``finance.reversals.window_days`` before
it. An original posted on the reversal's own day is a candidate only when there is no
earlier one, because a statement's order within a day is not a direction. Matching
reads the wording flags, the account, the currency, the amount and the posting date
only: the bank prints no payee, or not the original one, on a reversal.

**Outcomes**, for each group of lines the candidate edges connect:

- one edge, to an earlier original: the edge is applied, and both lines are
  ``pair_kind = reversal``, ``transfer_state = paired`` (shown as ``reversed``). A
  paired line adds zero to spending and income and is never payment evidence,
  allocation material, or a trade, loan or rent candidate; a confirmed ``split`` on a
  reversed credit stays a decision and makes no parts;
- one edge, to a same-day original: the reversal is ``ambiguous``, its confirm item
  showing that one candidate; the original stays an ordinary line, nothing netted;
- two or more edges (two candidates for one reversal, or two reversals for one
  original): every line of the group is ``ambiguous``, nothing netted;
- a reversal with no candidate is ``unresolved``.

Every candidate edge is stored in ``pair_edge`` (kind ``reversal``, ``a_txn_id`` the
reversal, ``b_txn_id`` the original), applied or not. A re-sent payment is an ordinary
line and counts once.

**The owner's decisions** (``pair_decisions``, read before this stage). An edge
joining exactly an ``unpair``'s two lines is never stored, so its lines group and
resolve as if it had never been a candidate: a freed original is an ordinary line
again and reaches stage 9. A line a ``pair`` took is an end of no edge but its
decision's: the decision's edge is stored when it is a candidate, and when the
decision joins two lines on one account, in one currency, of exactly opposite amounts
that have no candidate edge, stage 8 stores that edge too (``a_txn_id`` the later
line by posting date, then id). Stage 8 applies none of its decision's edges; stage
11 applies them and states their lines.
