"""Derivation stage 11, the fee lines of what it applied (FR-15, FR-15(c), Key
decision 9, edge cases 2, 3, 5 and 70). ``stage11.resolve`` decides the edges and
calls ``book``.

**Three ways a movement books a fee**, each at most one line:

- **A decided ``pair`` that nets.** A fiat ``pair`` with legs (three lines or more)
  nets once: the target against the sum of every other line it names, so a payment
  paid by two credits is one movement and at most one fee line, on the OUTBOUND side
  (the target when it is the debit, else the first debit among the others, counting
  only the lines left once the isolated conversions' legs are taken out), keyed to
  the decision's first edge (in the order of its lines) that is no isolated conversion
  and names no printed fee. An ISOLATED conversion edge of the pair (neither of its
  ends is an end of another conversion edge of the pair) keeps its own rule (below):
  its printed fee is the only fee line of its date, else its spread is booked on the
  edge, and the net leaves its two legs out at their own CAD values (stage 4), so
  neither its spread nor the rate of an in-leg posted another day reaches the net,
  and neither its date nor its account places the net. A
  conversion that shares an end with another (one leg fanned out to two on the
  account, either way round) has no rule of its own: the whole pair nets once, as an
  own transfer would; and when any such fanned conversion names a printed fee (as
  stored, before the shared ones are cleared), that fee is the only fee line of its
  date and the pair books no net beside it (FR-15(c)), the residual booked nowhere,
  as when every edge names one. With no key edge there is no net; with a leg of an
  isolated conversion unconverted the net is unmeasured. The net of a pair with legs is
  floored at zero, as a spread is (FR-15(c)): a favourable residual (the credits
  worth more than the debits) books no line, never income. A two-line fiat ``pair``
  nets the same way when its edge is an ``own_transfer``, with the signed net of
  FR-15 and no floor; a two-line ``reversal`` is of exactly opposite amounts, and a
  two-line ``conversion`` books its spread (below). A crypto ``pair`` books no fee.
- **An applied fiat ``own_transfer``** no decision touched, whose legs do not net to
  zero (inside the tolerance), books the net.
- **An applied ``conversion``** books its spread (below).

**A net** is one txn of origin ``derived_fee`` on the OUTBOUND account (the debit's),
dated and recognized as the debit, ``fee_type`` ``fee``, with no transfer state, so it
counts once in spending (a positive net counts against it). Lines in one currency net
natively: in CAD the fee is native, in another currency it takes the debit's own
conversion (its rate, its state, unconverted when the debit is). Lines in two
currencies net by their CAD values, and the fee is that CAD figure; with a line
unconverted nothing can be measured and no fee is booked. The edge's ``fee_txn_id``
names the fee line. Its id is ``derived_id`` over the edge, and its one source is a
``manual_ref`` naming the edge (``FEE_REF``), since no document line prints it. A fee
a parser already printed is its own line before this stage and is netted out of
nothing here: a transfer whose legs balance after it makes no derived fee.

**Conversion fees** (FR-15(c)). An applied ``conversion`` makes exactly one fee line on
its date. When stage 9 named the issuer's printed fee line (``fee_txn_id``), that line
is the one and the spread is booked nowhere. A printed fee line belongs to at most one
conversion: when the conversion edges of two or more out-legs name the same one (two
conversions with the same wording on one account and day, so the line cannot be told
to be either one's), no edge keeps it, and none of those conversions books a derived
fee either, since a printed fee is the only fee line of its date. The rule reads the
whole stored edge set, so it does not depend on order. Otherwise a positive spread
becomes one ``derived_fee`` txn of ``-spread_cad`` CAD on the conversion's account,
dated and recognized as the out-leg, ``fee_type`` ``conversion_fee``, named by the
edge's ``fee_txn_id``. A spread of zero or below is a zero fee: no line, never income.
A conversion with no spread (no stored rate) makes no fee line until a rate exists.
