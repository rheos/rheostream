"""Derivation stage 1: parse the registered documents (FR-3, FR-5, FR-9).

Each document parsed goes through ``parsers.registry.parse_document``, which deletes
the document's own lines, periods and rejection event first and then stores the
outcome, so the result depends only on the bytes, the parsers and the account
registry.

A parse is kept rather than redone when none of those three moved. ``parse_inputs``
hashes the last two for one document: its issuer and format, the id and version of
every parser registered for them, for a PDF the installed ``doc-extraction-api``
(``docextract_adapter.docextract_version``: it extracts the text and holds the rules),
when one of those parsers sets hints the issuer wording it reads
(``reference.patterns.patterns_digest``), and the account registry (``account``
joined to its identifiers, as the parsers see it). Each parse stores that hash on the
document.
Without ``reparse`` (``finance.ledger.derive``), a document is parsed again only when
it was never parsed, its stored hash differs from the current one, its file is not at
its path with its own sha256 (the file left the archive, was withheld or now holds
other bytes), or its last outcome was about the file rather than its content (one of
``FILE_REASONS``: the file is back now); otherwise its stored parse output stands.
With ``reparse`` (``finance.ledger.rebuild``) every document is parsed again.

The account registry enters the hash whole: an account that leaves or joins, or any
identifier change, parses every document again. shortcut: broader than needed only
in cost, never in result; scope it to the parser's institution if registry edits ever
make derives slow.

After parsing, ``precedence.supersede`` marks ``superseded`` each parsed document
that an equally ranked one with a larger sha256 repeats for exactly the same periods,
so stage 3 reads one copy. Superseding is decided again on every run over the whole
set, so a kept document marked ``superseded`` last time starts this run ``parsed``.
