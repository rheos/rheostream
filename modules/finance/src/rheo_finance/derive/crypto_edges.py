"""Derivation stage 9 for crypto: own-wallet transfers, two-sided and one-sided, as
candidate edges (FR-15(b), edge cases 24, 39 and 77; SPEC Derivation stage 9).

Like the fiat part of stage 9 (``stage9``), this stores candidate edges in
``pair_edge`` with ``applied`` false, and stage 11 decides which apply, counting the
edges of every kind on a line together.

**Which lines.** Crypto txns of kind ``crypto_transfer`` or ``crypto_unclassified``
(stage 7) with a nonzero quantity, a time and no exclusion, and no
``crypto_labels.csv`` label (``labelled``): a labelled line is the owner's to account
for and starts or ends no pairing. A fee line (``crypto_fee``) and a swap leg are never
an end. Reading a line reads its primary source (``pairing.source_lines``) for
``fee_stated``: the primary's figure is the txn's.

**``own_transfer``.** A withdrawal of kind ``crypto_transfer`` (transfer-like) to a
deposit of the same asset code on another account:

- with a TXID on both sides, only when the TXIDs are equal (``txid_key``: a hex TXID
  compared in lower case, without a leading ``0x``); the TXID settles it, whatever
  the times or the figures;
- otherwise when the deposit's quantity equals the withdrawal's within
  ``finance.crypto.qty_epsilon``, or, when the withdrawal's line has ``fee_stated``
  false (one printed figure that may include an unstated fee), when the deposit is
  smaller by at most ``finance.crypto.fee_tolerance_pct`` percent of the withdrawal
  (a fee only ever lowers what arrives; a deposit line states no fee of its own), and
  the two times are at most ``finance.crypto.transfer_window_hours`` apart;
- when the withdrawal's destination is an ``own_address`` (compared as
  ``manual.own_addresses.normalize_address`` holds it), only on that address's
  account.

``a_txn_id`` is the withdrawal, ``b_txn_id`` the deposit. An edge's id is derived on
the UTC date of the withdrawal's time, never its local posting date. A crypto pair
books no derived fee line (stage 11 makes those for fiat legs only).

**``own_one_sided``** (edge case 77). A withdrawal whose destination is an own address
of account X and that has no ``own_transfer`` candidate (X's rows are not loaded, or
the receiving row is missing) gets one edge with ``a_txn_id`` the withdrawal, no
``b_txn_id`` and ``b_account_id`` X. When it is the line's only edge stage 11 applies
it: the line is ``paired`` with ``pair_kind = own_one_sided``, in no total and no
disposal, and raises no ``finance.withdrawal.flagged``. When the receiving row loads,
the next derive finds the ``own_transfer`` candidate instead and the line pairs two
sided, with no decision.

**The owner's decisions** (``pair_decisions``, read before stage 8). No edge joining
exactly an ``unpair``'s lines is stored, and a line a ``pair`` took is an end of no
edge but its decision's. A one-line ``pair`` of a withdrawal to an own address keeps
only its ``own_one_sided`` edge. When two crypto lines (on two accounts, in one asset,
opposite in direction) a ``pair`` joins have no candidate edge, an ``own_transfer``
joins them whatever the TXIDs, figures or times say, ``a_txn_id`` the smaller
quantity. A ``pair`` no stage could store in full is inert (``pair_decisions``), so it
reaches no stage.
