"""Derivation stage 3, part one: the lines of parsed documents and the manual cash lines
become txns (FR-4, FR-13, Key decisions 3, 4 and 5).

**Natural key.** A fiat document line is keyed by (account slug, posting date, signed
amount, currency, normalized description, occurrence), the occurrence counting the
identical lines before it in the same document, so two identical same-day lines both
survive and a document's keys depend on no other document. A manual cash line has its
own key space (a leading ``manual``), counted among manual lines only, so a statement
that later prints the same line neither takes its id nor shifts it. A txn's id and its
primary source's ``line_key_id`` are ``derived_id`` of the key on the posting date; an
additional source keeps its own line's key, so a reference to a txn that a better
source later replaced still resolves. Every keyed line stores its key and normalized
description back on ``document_line``.

**What becomes a txn.** Lines of kind ``transaction`` with a posting date, an amount and
a currency, from documents with status ``parsed``, decided by ``overlap.match_lines``
over the documents in ``precedence`` order: a txn (with its basis and provisional
flag), an additional source of a txn, or a ``source_discrepancy`` row. A transaction
line missing one of the three is left out and counted (``Lines.incomplete_lines``).
Crypto movement and fee lines have their own keys and matching (``crypto_lines``).
Receipt and invoice lines are part two (``evidence``), matched against every txn part
one wrote, the manual lines included. Other line kinds belong to stages and features
that are not built yet (trading results, holdings, notices) and are left alone.

**Manual lines.** The currency of a line must be one its account takes
(``account.currencies``). A line in another currency is not loaded: it is reported as a
``manual_entry_error`` row on its ``transactions.csv`` line, like every other bad manual
row, and counted in the result.
