"""The real snapshot provider: a line reference to what the line looks like now.

``txn_snapshot`` has the contract of ``context.SnapshotProvider`` and is what the
production context uses (``composition.build_context``). It resolves
``finance.txn:<uuid>`` through ``txn_source.line_key_id``, not through ``txn.id``, so a
reference taken on a provisional line still resolves after a statement line replaces it
(the old key stays on the txn as a source). Several sources of one txn may carry the
same key (a CSV and a PDF that print a purchase alike); a key never names two txns
(migration 0011). A reference no current line carries gives ``None``, and so does
anything that is not a well-formed ``finance.txn`` reference. An evidence source (a
receipt that matched a payment) is not a line of the payment and does not resolve.
