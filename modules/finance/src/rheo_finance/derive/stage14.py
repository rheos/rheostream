"""Derivation stage 14: the obligations (FR-19, FR-21; Key decision 20; SPEC Data Models
``obligation``). Nothing outside this stage creates one, and a card charge from a
subscription vendor is a spending line only. The paths are in the table above
``create_obligations``.

- (1) A card statement: a parsed statement that states a balance owed gives
  ``card_statement``, period ``card-YYYY-MM-DD`` of its closing date, issued on it.
  ``threshold_due`` is the printed minimum, else the full balance.
- (2) A parsed bill: a parsed document of kind ``bill`` gives ``bill``, period
  ``bill-YYYY-MM`` of its due month, issued on its printed bill date. A later bill of
  one payee due in one month takes ``-2``, ``-3`` in (bill date, due date, path) order,
  which ``report_status`` counts for status line 9. A parsed bill that prints no total
  due has no amount to owe and makes no obligation.
- (3) A manual bill: one ``bill`` per ``obligations.csv`` row, typed in whether or not a
  parser reads that issuer's bills. The document its row names, when one is registered
  at that path, is its primary source and makes nothing of its own; otherwise the row
  is.
- (4) An arrangement: one ``arrangement_instalment`` per ``arrangements.csv`` row,
  period ``inst-<slug>-<n>``, issued on ``agreed_on``; and arrears, below.
- (5) A manual debt: one ``manual_debt`` per ``obligations.csv`` row, period
  ``debt-<slug>``, with the row's ``issued_on`` and due date, either of which may be
  null; and one per invoice stage 3 found unpaid (``evidence.UnpaidInvoice``: no
  payment matches it and the decision in force is ``invoice_unpaid``). That one's period
  is ``debt-inv-<line key>``, the key of the invoice line, which every re-saved copy of
  the invoice document shares, so a new copy keeps the id a decision names. It is owed
  the smallest amount due its copies print, else the total, issued on the invoice's date
  and due on the decision's date if it gives one; ``invoice_ref`` names the document
  that counts. Its
  payee is the first payee whose patterns name the printed payee, else the vendor payee
  of the invoice's archive directory (``manual.payees``).

A document ``precedence.supersede`` marked as a copy is not parsed, so it makes nothing.
Two different parsed statements of one card with one closing date have one natural key,
so they are one obligation: the one ``precedence`` ranks first. When their balance,
minimum or due date differ, the row's ``statement_conflict`` says so, for status line 9.

**A manual row and a document.** A manual row with the key of a parsed document is one
obligation with it: the document's figures win, the row stays in ``manual_source``, and
the row's amount less the document's printed total is ``manual_mismatch``, null when
they agree. A ``bill`` row's minimum is kept as written and is never its threshold: only
a card's threshold is its minimum.

**The payee.** The payee standing for the account (``payee.account_id``), else the
payee named by the account's slug for a statement or the issuer's slug for a bill. Stage
2 makes a card's and an issuer's exist (``manual.payees``). A statement that states an
amount owed on an account not registered as a card has none: ``NoPayee`` fails the
derive rather than dropping what is owed. A manual row and an arrangement name their
payee by slug, and the loaders refuse an unknown one.

**A bill row naming the issuer.** An account with its own payee takes its parsed bills
from the issuer's payee, so a typed bill naming the issuer's slug would be owed beside
the parsed bill it copies. When every parsed bill of the issuer is owed to one other
payee, the row is read as that payee's and merges or chains there. Parsed bills owed to
two or more other payees leave nothing to say which one it means: the row stays on the
issuer's payee and is ``unjoined``. With no parsed bill yet there is nothing to count
twice, and the row stays where it was written.

**Supersession (FR-21).** Per (payee, account, kind), so two accounts of one issuer stay
two chains, oldest issue first, each newer row names the one before it in
``supersedes_id`` and the one before it is ``superseded``. A statement's balance and
minimum already hold what the previous one carried, and a bill's total holds the unpaid
balance before it, so only the newest is owed.

**Which manual bills chain.** A payee is a bill source when it has a parsed bill, is a
bill issuer (``manual.payees.bill_issuers``), or stands for a ``bill_vendor`` account.
Its bills are one running account, typed in or parsed: a manual bill joins the chain by
``issued_on``, so a newer bill supersedes an older one in either direction and a bill
typed from a photo is never owed beside the bill that carries it. Its account is the
one the payee's parsed bills are on, else the one the payee stands for. Parsed bills on
two accounts leave it no account to join: it then chains only with the payee's other
manual bills and is ``unjoined``, which status line 9 counts, because it stays open
beside the parsed bills that may carry it. Any other payee is invoice-style: a manual
invoice does not carry the one before it, so two of them are both owed. A manual debt
never chains, and a manual row merged into a document is that document's row.

**Arrangements and arrears.** Every bill period an arrangement ``replaces`` is
``superseded``, and names the arrangement in ``arrangement_ref``, from then on: when the
last instalment is paid the arrangement stops being active, and the replaced periods
must not come back as owed. An arrangement is active until stage 15's application has
paid every one of its instalments (``finished``, handed back by ``derive.run`` with the
day the last one was paid). A bill issued up to that day plus
``finance.payments.early_days`` stays governed by it for good, since its instalments
covered that bill's arrears and a bill cut before the last payment posts still prints
them; only a bill issued after that is owed as with no arrangement. While an
arrangement governs a payee's bill, the newest bill
of each of its accounts is owed for its printed current charges only, or for its total
less its printed arrears when it prints no current charges. A typed-in bill prints
neither, so it is owed as typed. With none governing it, a bill that prints arrears
is split: the bill is owed its total less the arrears, and an ``arrears`` row, period
``arrears-YYYY-MM`` of the bill date, holds the arrears, so the two add up to the total
printed and instalments and arrears are never both owed. Only the newest bill of an
account states arrears: an older figure is folded into it. A carried balance that is
not labelled arrears (a bill's unpaid balance) stays in the bill's own total, which one
payment can then match.

The total printed caps all of this. A credit carried on a bill can leave its total below
its current charges or its arrears line, and nothing is owed above what the bill asks
for: neither figure raises what is owed past the total, and neither takes a bill with a
total of zero or more below zero.

Rows leave here with ``paid`` zero, and a row with nothing remaining (a card at zero or
in credit) is ``paid`` rather than open; stage 15's application then writes what was
paid.

The id comes from the natural key alone, on the fixed registry date, so a figure or a
date that changes keeps the id a decision names.
