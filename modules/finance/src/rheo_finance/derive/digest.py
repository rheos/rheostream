"""The ledger's content digest (FR-5, AC-5): one sha256 over the canonical rows of
every derived table.

Which tables: every table a derive clears or rewrites (``run.CLEARED`` and
``run.REWRITTEN``) and the registry the file operation keeps (``run.FILE_OWNED``:
``document`` and ``archive_skip``), since a rebuild registers the archive again and
parsing writes each document's status. The state tables (``run.STATE``: decisions,
their items and their targets) are inputs, not derived, and are left out; so are the
report views, which only select from the tables.

Which columns: all of them but ``LEFT_OUT``, the times a row was written
(``sink_spec.computed_at``, ``document.imported_at``) and the parse cache's key
(``document.parse_inputs``, bookkeeping about how a parse was reached, not what it
holds). ``occurred_at`` on a line or a txn is when the movement happened, data like any
date, and stays in.

Canonical rows: each value is tagged and rendered the way derived ids hash their
natural keys (``storage.ids.canonical_part``: numbers normalized, so ``1.50`` and
``1.5`` are one value; dates and times ISO, times in UTC; strings NFC), a list item by
item and a JSON object by sorted key. A row lists its primary key columns first, and
rows are hashed in the order of their canonical text, so a table with an ``id`` is in
id order and the digest never depends on the order the database returns rows in.
Nothing per run (a clock reading, a random id, a parser's unstored side output) is in
any digested column, which is what lets two runs over one document set agree.
