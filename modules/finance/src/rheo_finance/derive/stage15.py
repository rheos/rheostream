"""Derivation stage 15, the payments: which ones there are, and what each was seen in
(FR-22, Key decision 18; SPEC Derivation stage 15, Money payments and Notices; edge
cases 15, 17, 34, 74 and 83). What a payment pays is the next step, and reads these
rows. This one reads no obligation, so it can run on either side of stage 14.

**A money line** is a fiat line, not excluded and not a fee, that left an account and
whose wording names a payee: the first in ``Payees`` order that a pattern of it names,
so one line is one payment however many payees name it. A document expense (the internal
account's txn of a receipt or a decided invoice) is named by its printed payee too.

**A card** (a payee standing for a ``credit_card`` account) is paid when money reaches
it: its money lines are the payment credits on that account (``transfer_like``, or the
parser's ``transfer_hint`` on a credit stage 8 took out of stage 9's reading, never a
refund). A debit elsewhere that names the card is one of three things:

- with an applied ``own_transfer`` edge, the other leg of the card's credit: never a
  payment of its own;
- with none, in a month coverage says the card has no lines for (``missing``,
  ``unparsed``, ``rejected``, or no row at all), the only evidence, so it is the
  payment;
- with none, in a month the card has lines for, a ``confirm_only`` payment ("payment to
  <card>?"), so an unpaired debit can neither apply twice nor vanish. A debit with no
  state (no transfer wording) is the same: nothing joined it.

A debit on the card itself that names the card (a returned payment) pays nothing.

**A payee standing for an account** is paid only as a card is, or as a vendor when
its account is a ``bill_vendor`` (an account that holds the vendor's bills and no
money). Words naming a payee that stands for any other account (chequing, savings, a
wallet) name nobody to pay: money sent there stays the owner's.

**One payment.** Lines joined by applied ``own_transfer`` edges are one payment when
one of them is a card's credit: that credit is its money line and the others are
``joined``. A group with no card credit is money moved between the owner's own
accounts, with no leg outside them, so it is no payment whatever payee a debit's
wording names. Any other money line is its own payment. Nothing here merges two lines
by amount or date, so two equal payments stay two.

**Reversed.** A line stage 8 (or the owner's ``pair``) made the original of an applied
``reversal`` edge is a ``reversed`` payment: it applies nothing and still takes its
notices. The reversal line itself, or any line with reversal wording left unpaired,
undoes something and is no payment. A line paired any other way (a conversion leg) is
none either.

**Notices.** A ``payment_notice`` line of a parsed document has no account. Its stream
is (the document's issuer, the line's ``source_type``); mail intake sets both. It is
keyed within its stream as a receipt is (``evidence.evidence_key``; copies of one notice
have one key, and the larger sha256 counts), and this stage stores the key on the line,
so a decision names it as ``finance.payment_notice:<key>``. Its payee is the first that
a pattern of it names in the printed ``counterparty``, else in the description. A notice
that names no payee and that no decision places makes no payment.

In order, each notice joining at most one payment:

1. The owner's ``pair`` and ``unpair`` on a (notice, line), the newest of each such
   couple holding. The newest ``pair`` of a notice joins it to the payment that line is
   evidence of, whatever the amount or date. A ``pair`` whose line is evidence of no
   payment is inert. An ``unpair`` bars that payment from steps 2 and 3.
2. Candidates: money payments of the notice's payee and currency, in any state, of an
   equal amount (``finance.payments.match_tolerance``) with dates within
   ``finance.payments.evidence_window_days``, taken by date gap, then payment id, then
   notice key. A payment takes at most one notice per stream.
3. A notice left over is **held** when such a money payment lies within
   ``finance.payments.notice_hold_days`` either side: a ``confirm_only`` payment of its
   own, ``notice_only``, so a bank line that posts late never makes a phantom credit.
   Otherwise it is an ``active`` notice-only payment, so what is owed drops when the
   email arrives before the statement. Leftovers are taken oldest first (then by key),
   and one is held too when an ``active`` notice-only payment of the same payee,
   currency and amount, from another stream, lies within the hold window: two emails
   about one payment count once (FR-22)."""
