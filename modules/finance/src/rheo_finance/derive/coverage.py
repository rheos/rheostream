"""Derivation stage 6: the coverage matrix (FR-6, AC-6).

For each account, one row per calendar month from its first known date to the later
of this month (in ``finance.locale.timezone``) and its last dated record. The first
known date is the earliest of the opened date, the first document period and the first
line; it is written back to ``account.first_known_on``. An account with no opened date
and no data has no months (status shows it as "no data").

Each month takes the first state that holds:

1. ``not_applicable``: wholly before the opened date or wholly after the closed date.
2. ``have``: every day of the month the account was open is verified in every currency
   the account takes. Verified spans: a tied-out ``summary`` period (a statement), each
   continuous run of a ``running_balance`` period (``parsers.base.balance_runs`` run
   again over the stored lines, in line order), and a ``bill_identity`` period (a parsed
   bill, whose period is its bill-date month when it prints none).
3. ``rejected``: a rejected document's period on the account overlaps the month
   (``rejected_period``).
4. ``unparsed``: an ``unparsed`` or ``needs_manual_entry`` document with a known period
   on the account (from ``document_periods.csv``) overlaps the month.
5. ``partial``: some day is verified in some currency, or a ledger line is dated in the
   month (reason ``running_balance_break`` when the month holds a day strictly between
   the two lines of a running-balance break, else none), or the month overlaps the
   stated period of an unverified (control ``none``) export (reason ``export_period``).
6. ``missing``: with reason ``running_balance_break`` when the month holds a day
   strictly between the two lines of a break, else the account's ``missing_reason``
   when the month starts before its ``missing_before``, else none. So
   ``missing_before`` only names the reason for a month nothing else covers.

The built-in "Paid outside recorded accounts" (``INTERNAL_ACCOUNT``) gets no months:
it has no source by design, so every month without a cash line would read ``missing``.
Its first known date is still written.

Only ``parsed`` documents count, so a ``superseded`` copy covers nothing of its own: the
copy it repeats is the parsed one and covers the period. File names never count (only
parsed periods, stored lines and entered periods do), and neither do ``trading_export``
documents or trading lines, which carry results, not the account's movements.

A ``none``-control export verifies nothing, so a month resting on its lines alone is at
best ``partial``. The mail rules (``no_raw_mail``, ``mail_purged`` from the first parsed
email, ``mail_window``) belong to the mail intake stage, not built yet.
