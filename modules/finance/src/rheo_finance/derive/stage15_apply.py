"""Derivation stage 15, application: what each payment paid (FR-21, FR-22; Key decisions
18 and 20; SPEC Derivation stage 15 "Application"; edge cases 14 to 17, 34 and 66).
Stage 14 made the obligations and ``stage15`` the payments; this reads both and writes
``payment_application``, then each obligation's ``paid``, ``remaining``,
``threshold_remaining``, status and ``payments_mismatch``.

Only an ``active`` payment applies: a ``reversed`` one applies nothing, so whatever it
had paid reopens, and a ``confirm_only`` one waits for the owner. Each active payment's
rows add up to its amount, in its currency: what it paid, and the rest as an unapplied
credit (a row with no obligation) with its reason.

**Order.** Payments go in ``paid_on`` order (then id), the owner's decisions first, then
the rules, so a decided payment has taken its share before a rule reads a remaining.

**Decisions.** ``payment_apply`` and ``payment_unapply`` name a payment by any line or
notice it was seen in (``finance.txn:<id>``, ``finance.payment_notice:<key>``). Newest
first per obligation: a ``payment_apply`` places the payment on the obligation it names,
for its ``amount`` when it gives one, else up to that obligation's remaining, whatever
the bound or the window; a ``payment_unapply`` naming an obligation bars it; one naming
none bars every older decision of that payment. A payment with an apply in force takes
nothing from the rules, and what is left over is ``excess``. One with only an unapply in
force applies nothing: the whole of it is a credit of reason ``payment_unapply``, so
undoing an application restores the remaining it had before. A decision naming an
obligation that does not exist, or a payment that is not active, changes nothing, and
neither does a ``payment_apply`` on a payment in another currency (every obligation is
in CAD); its ``payment_unapply`` still takes it off the rules.

**Cards, with no early_days slack.** A payment to a card's payee belongs to the card's
statement whose ``statement_date`` is the latest on or before ``paid_on``, whatever its
status (``disputed`` aside): a minimum paid on statement N's due date stays on N when
N+1 loads, because N+1's balance already nets it. Paid toward it, the payment fills the
threshold first, simply because ``threshold_remaining`` is the threshold less what was
paid. More than the remaining is ``excess``, never carried onto the next statement; less
is a partial payment, which applies when ``card_statement`` is in
``finance.payments.partial_auto_kinds`` and is a ``confirm`` credit otherwise. A card
payment dated before the card's earliest statement is ``no_target``; one in a currency
other than CAD is a ``confirm`` credit when its statement has something left past
the tolerance (below), and ``no_target`` when not. A superseded statement keeps what
was applied to it and lends nothing to the newer one.

**Every other kind.** An obligation is a candidate when its ``issued_on`` is on or
before ``paid_on`` plus ``finance.payments.early_days`` (a null ``issued_on`` is no
bound), and live when it is also ``open`` or ``partial`` as the payments before this one
left it. Among the live candidates:

- the ones whose remaining is the amount within ``match_tolerance`` (one live candidate
  or several, edge case 15): it pays the oldest of them, unless the oldest two were
  issued and are due on the same days, when nothing says which and it is ``confirm``;
- else, when every live candidate's kind is in the partial set (an arrangement's
  instalments by default), it fills them oldest first and the rest is ``excess``;
- else it is a ``confirm`` credit: two candidates and neither fits.

Oldest is by ``issued_on``, then due date, then the period label in its natural order
(``inst-plan-2`` before ``inst-plan-10``). With no live candidate, an obligation
the stage left ``superseded`` (or presumed paid) whose own window holds ``paid_on`` is
the target when the amount fits its ``amount_due`` or its kind is in the partial set:
the window runs from its ``issued_on`` less ``early_days`` up to, not including, the
next ``issued_on`` of the payee's same kind plus ``early_days`` (open for the newest;
one ``issued_on`` shared is one window). Two such targets, the amount picks one, else
``confirm``; one the amount does not fit, ``confirm``. With none (every candidate paid
already, or out of its window, or no candidate at all) it is ``no_target``, with
``bound_on`` the latest issue date a target could have had; ``excess`` is only the part
of a payment above what its target had left. So a credit never rolls forward onto an
obligation issued after it: it leaves that state by a decision or by a target that
passes the bound loading later. Only a CAD payment pays an obligation, since every
obligation is in CAD: another currency's payment is a ``confirm`` credit when a live
candidate has something to pay, and ``no_target`` when none has.

**Tolerance.** A payment within ``match_tolerance`` of what is left settles it: a
remaining (or threshold remaining) at or under the tolerance once something was paid is
written as zero, so a cent short leaves no overdue cent behind.

**Status.** ``open``, ``partial`` or ``paid`` from what was paid. A status stage 14 set
otherwise (``superseded``, and later ``disputed``) stays: a superseded row still shows
what was applied to it. ``presumed_paid`` stays only while nothing is paid: it is not a
live candidate, and once a payment applies to it (in its own window, or by a
``payment_apply``) it reverts to ``partial`` or ``paid`` with its remaining, while the
decision stays on record and changes nothing.

**FR-21.** For each obligation that supersedes another and whose document prints a
payments figure (a card statement's ``total_payments``), the payments applied to its
payee dated after the older one's date and on or before its own are compared with that
figure; applied less printed is ``payments_mismatch`` ("applied X, statement shows Y"),
null when they agree.

**Arrangements.** ``finished_arrangements`` reads, after an application, the
arrangements whose every instalment is paid, each with the day the last one was paid;
``derive.run`` hands them back to stage 14, whose arrangement rule then no longer
governs a bill issued after that day plus ``early_days``, and applies again. A payment
that finished an arrangement is dated on or before that day, so its bound never
reaches a bill that finishing ungoverns, and the rules alone settle in one round; a
``payment_apply`` naming an arrears row that exists only once the arrangement is
finished moves the payment off it, and then no finished set holds. ``settled`` then
keeps the arrangements every round finished on one day (the rest stay active, their
bills governed, so nothing is owed twice) and ``mark_unsettled`` flags the instalments
of the rest, which status line 9 names (``arrangement_unsettled``), each instalment
with the decision that moved its payment off it (``unsettled_decision_id``).

**Events.** Each automatic application to an obligation registers one
``finance.payment.detected`` (``record_detected``): the payment, its payee and the
obligation, never an amount.
