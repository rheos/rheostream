"""The owner's ``pair`` and ``unpair`` decisions as the pairing stages read them (FR-15,
FR-18; SPEC Derivation stage 11, Data Models ``decision`` and ``decision_item``).

``read`` runs once per derive, after stage 7 and before stage 8, and its ``Decided``
goes to stages 8, 9 (fiat and crypto) and 11, so the candidate graph is built around
the decisions rather than repaired after them.

**Lines.** A decision names lines by ``finance.txn:<uuid>`` references whose id is a
line key (``txn_source.line_key_id``), never a txn id: the target, then the
counterpart, then each ``leg`` item in ``seq`` order. A key resolves to the txn that
carries it as a primary or an additional source, so a decision holds through a
rebuild and through a change of a line's primary source (the old key stays on the txn
as an additional source). A decision with a reference that is not a line (a notice,
which the notice stage reads) or a key no current line carries (an orphan, which the
orphan stage finds) is left out here, and so is one naming a line twice.

**Edge sets.** A ``pair`` joins its target to each other line it names, one edge
each; with no other line it names the target's ``own_one_sided`` edge (``{target}``).
An ``unpair`` names the one edge joining exactly its lines.

**Which apply.** Unreversed decisions (``decision.reversed_clause``, a bulk run's
reversal included), newest first (``decided_at``, then id). Each edge set belongs to
the newest decision naming it, so a later ``unpair`` undoes an earlier ``pair`` and the
other way round. A ``pair`` applies only when none of its edge sets is a newer
decision's and none of its lines is taken by a newer ``pair``; then it takes its
lines. A ``pair`` applies in full or not at all: it is inert (recorded, applying
nothing, taking nothing, so its lines resolve as if it were absent) when any one of
its edges is one no stage would store:

- it mixes fiat and crypto lines (no edge kind joins them);
- one fiat line: a fiat line has no one-sided edge;
- two fiat lines of one sign (a hand pair needs a debit and a credit), or a fiat line
  stage 8 does not read (zero, excluded) or, for an edge stage 8 would not store (not
  of reversal shape: one account, one currency, exactly opposite amounts), a line
  stage 9 does not read (a party's line);
- one crypto line that is not a withdrawal to an own address (``crypto_edges`` stores
  a one-sided edge for no other);
- two crypto lines on one account, in two assets or of one direction, or a crypto line
  ``crypto_edges`` does not read (a swap leg, a fee line, a labelled, excluded or zero
  line).

The line filters are the stages' own (each stage's ``LINES``), so this check and the
stages agree on what can be stored.

**What the stages do with it** (``Decided.allows``): an edge joining exactly an
``unpair``'s lines is never stored; a line a ``pair`` took is an end of no edge except
the edges of its decision, which the stages build when no ordinary candidate exists
(stage 8 a reversal-shaped pair, stage 9 any other fiat pair, ``crypto_edges`` a
crypto pair).
