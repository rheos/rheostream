"""``run``: rebuild every derived table in one transaction (FR-5, Key decisions 3
and 4). The run is a savepoint of the caller's transaction, so a derive that fails
leaves every table as it found it, whatever the caller does next.

``finance.ledger.derive`` calls it as is; ``finance.ledger.rebuild`` registers the
archive again first and passes ``reparse``. Both give the same ledger for the same
document set: a derive keeps only stored parse output that a parse would reproduce
(``stage1``), and everything after stage 1 is recomputed from the stored parse output
either way.

Order of work, set by what each step reads:

1. Clear the derived tables that hold rows keyed to accounts, lines and documents: the
   payments, the coverage matrix, the pairing graph, the ``txn`` tables, the source
   discrepancies, the obligations, the events and the manual entry errors
   (``manual_entry_error``, whole: stages 2 and 3 run in full on every derive and
   write the errors of every file they read, so a row under a file none of them reads
   does not outlive a derive). The parse cache (``PARSE_CACHE``: lines, periods,
   rejected periods and the rejection events) is cleared whole with ``reparse``;
   otherwise stage 1 clears and rewrites a document's rows when it parses that
   document, and the columns stage 3 writes on a line (``STAGE3_LINE_COLUMNS``) go back
   to null, as a parse leaves them. State
   tables (decisions and their snapshots) are never touched, and neither are the
   registry tables the file operation owns (``document``, ``archive_skip``).
2. Stage 2, the manual files: accounts and identifiers first. The parsers match
   accounts from the account table, so this comes before stage 1 although its number is
   higher. The loaders rewrite their own tables.
3. Stage 1, the registered documents through the parser registry, each one only when
   its stored parse is missing or out of date (all of them with ``reparse``). A
   document whose account left the registry is parsed again against the new one, so
   no stale account key reaches the foreign-key check. Then repeated copies of one
   document are ``superseded`` (``precedence.supersede``).
4. Stage 3, lines to txns: documents ranked per account, the overlap matcher, the
   source discrepancies (``stage3``, ``precedence``, ``overlap``), then the receipts
   and invoices linked to the txns as evidence (``evidence``), by the payee patterns
   stage 2 loaded, and the ``invoice_paid`` decisions booked.
5. Stage 4, conversion to CAD from the stored rates (``stage4``); stage 5,
   recognition dates (``stage5``); then stage 6, the coverage matrix (``coverage``),
   which reads the periods, the lines and ``document_periods.csv``; then stage 7, the
   exclusions and the crypto movement kinds (``stage7``), which reads the own
   addresses stage 2 stored and the ``include`` decisions; then the owner's ``pair``
   and ``unpair`` decisions are read once (``pair_decisions``) for stages 8, 9 and
   11, which build and resolve the candidate graph around them; then stage 8, the
   reversals in both directions (``stage8``), which reads the lines' reversal wording
   and the ``reversal`` rows of ``transfer_hints.csv``; then stage 9, the fiat own
   transfer and same-account conversion candidate edges (``stage9``), which reads the
   lines' transfer and conversion wording, the other rows of that file, the CAD values,
   the stored rates and the lines stage 8 paired, and the crypto own-wallet transfer
   edges (``crypto_edges``), which read the crypto kinds stage 7 set, the own
   addresses and the crypto labels; then stage 11, resolution (``stage11``): the
   owner's ``pair`` and ``unpair`` decisions apply first, then the
   mutually unique edges apply, every transfer-like line gets its state, a labelled
   crypto line is set aside, an unresolved crypto withdrawal is flagged, and an applied
   transfer's net or conversion's spread becomes a derived fee line; then stage 14, the
   obligations (``stage14``), which read the parsed periods and the payees stage 2
   stored, the manual obligations and arrangements it holds, and the invoices stage 3
   found unpaid; then stage 15, the payments (``stage15``), which read the applied
   edges, the coverage matrix, the notice lines and the owner's decisions on them, and
   no obligation; then their application to the obligations (``stage15_apply``), with
   the ``payment_apply`` and ``payment_unapply`` decisions. When that application pays
   off an arrangement, stage 14 runs again with that arrangement finished and the day
   its last instalment was paid (a bill its payee is issued after that day plus
   ``finance.payments.early_days`` is owed as with no arrangement), and the
   application runs again over the new rows, until the finished set no longer changes
   (``FINISHED_ROUNDS``; a set still changing after that is settled the conservative
   way, ``stage15_apply.settled``, and the arrangements left out are marked for status
   line 9, ``stage15_apply.mark_unsettled``). Each time stage 14 makes the
   obligations, the ``presumed_paid`` decisions mark theirs (``presumed``) before the
   application reads them, and a payment applied to one reverts it. Then one
   ``finance.payment.detected`` per automatic application, and the obligations due
   before ``finance.reminders.min_due_date`` are marked (``presumed.mark_floor``).
6. Stage 16, events, persistent notices and actual parser overdrawn spells
   (``stage16``), then stage 17's orphan decisions and replacement candidates
   (``orphans``), then its open items (``open_items``).
7. Check the deferred constraints now, inside the run, so a violation fails the derive
   and not a commit nobody is watching; then defer them again, so a second derive in
   the same transaction clears the txn tables as the first did.
8. The sink specs (``sinks.store.write_sink_specs``), last.

A stage is a plain import at its step; a feature package that is not built yet has no
call site (Key decision 14).
