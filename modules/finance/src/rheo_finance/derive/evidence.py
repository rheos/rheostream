"""Derivation stage 3, part two: receipts and invoices (FR-8, FR-16; SPEC "Derivation"
stage 3, "Receipts and invoices"; Assumptions, matching windows).

A ``receipt`` or ``invoice`` line of a parsed document has no account: it is evidence
of a payment, not a payment. Once part one (``stage3``) has written every txn of the
statements, exports and manual cash lines, each such line is matched ONE to one
against payment lines:

- **What can match.** The same currency and signed amount (both are the owner's
  outflow, negative), a posting or transaction date of the txn within the window of
  the line's date (``finance.receipts.match_days`` for a receipt,
  ``finance.invoices.match_days`` for an invoice, either side of it), and the payee:
  one of the line's payee patterns is a whole-token run of the txn's description, both
  folded (``manual.payees.compared``: case, punctuation and whitespace). A line's payee
  patterns are its printed payee (its ``counterparty``) and the patterns of every payee
  one of whose patterns names that printed payee (``manual.payees``: the ``payees.csv``
  rows and the account-backed payees of ``accounts.csv`` ``payee_patterns``), so a
  receipt whose payee prints one name and whose card line prints another matches once
  the owner registers both as one payee. Only the txn of an unmatched receipt is also
  searched by its counterparty (the receipt's payee), so an invoice can attach to a
  receipt paid in cash; a statement or export line's counterparty is never read.
- **Which pairs.** Within each kind the matching is maximal: as many lines as can be
  matched one to one are, so a greedy choice never strands a receipt that had a
  payment of its own (that would count it twice). Among the maximal matchings the one
  with the least total date distance wins; the search runs over lines and payments in
  a fixed order (date, then id), so the same input always gives the same pairs.
  Matching is one to one within each kind and not across kinds: a receipt and an
  invoice of the same payment both attach to it, so a paid invoice never pushes its
  receipt out to "Paid outside recorded accounts" and counts it twice.
- **A match** adds a ``txn_source`` row with role ``evidence`` on the payment txn and
  adds nothing to spending.
- **An unmatched receipt** becomes its own txn on the internal account "Paid outside
  recorded accounts" at its date (a receipt proves payment): origin
  ``document_expense``, basis ``unverified_export`` (a receipt states no balance),
  the receipt line its primary source. The internal account takes CAD only; an
  unmatched receipt in another currency is refused and counted, never booked there
  (as a manual cash line in a currency its account does not take is).
- **Invoices match after the receipts are booked**, so an invoice may attach to the
  txn of an unmatched receipt (an invoice paid in cash with a receipt for it): the
  invoice is then evidence of that txn and stays open nowhere.
- **An unmatched invoice** becomes no txn, however old. It is left for stage 17's
  open items and the ``invoice_paid`` and ``invoice_unpaid`` decisions.
- **The owner's decision** on an invoice (``decision.effective``, the newest unreversed
  of the two kinds, on ``finance.invoice:<line key>``) applies only while no payment
  matches it. ``invoice_paid`` books it like an unmatched receipt: a txn on the internal
  account, at the decided date, origin ``document_expense``, the invoice line its
  primary source; the paying account stays on the decision. ``invoice_unpaid`` writes
  nothing here: the invoice is handed to stage 14 (``UnpaidInvoice``), which makes the
  debt, for the smallest amount due its copies print, else the total, so which copy
  counts never moves the debt. Either way the invoice is no longer open. Reversing the
  decision returns it to the open state on the next derive. An
  invoice in a currency the internal account does not take is refused and stays open,
  because neither a txn there nor an obligation can hold it: the line names the decision
  in ``refused_decision_id``, which status line 9 counts.
- **A match beats a decision**, so an invoice never counts twice: the payment takes the
  invoice as evidence, the decision adds nothing, and the evidence source names it in
  ``overrides_decision_id``, which status line 9 counts. A receipt's txn is a payment
  here, so an invoice paid in cash with a receipt stays on that one txn. An owner who
  decides an invoice was paid months after its date can have the payment line arrive
  later, outside the window of the invoice's date, so an ``invoice_paid`` invoice left
  unmatched is matched once more, by the decided date, against the payments on the
  decided account that no invoice took. A payment of the amount due a copy prints
  matches there as well as one of the total: the invoice printed what was left, and the
  owner's decision over that remainder is the same payment. That round runs after the
  first, so a decision moves no other invoice's match.

**Keys.** A receipt or invoice line is keyed by (kind, payee, date, signed amount,
currency, normalized description, the payment's reference digest, occurrence among
identical lines of its document), so its key depends on no other document and never
meets a fiat or manual key. The reference digest (``payment_ref_digest``, which the
receipt parser takes from the number a receipt prints for each payment) keeps two
genuine receipts that print the same date, amount and type apart. A second copy of
one document (a re-saved file, which stage 1 does not supersede because these
documents state no period) gives the same keys: lines of one key are one receipt or
invoice, matched once. The line of the document with the larger sha256 is the one
that counts (whatever order the copies were filed in); the copies are ``evidence``
sources of the txn it reached, so nothing counts twice. Every keyed line stores its
key and normalized description on ``document_line``, as part one does.
