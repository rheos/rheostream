"""The operation registry and ``dispatch`` (FR-52, FR-48, Key decision 21).

Every capability is one ``OperationSpec`` in ``SPECS``, named ``finance.<noun>.<verb>``.
Operations reach the database through ``dispatch``. The reminder job root uses
``owner_transaction`` for durable claims and acknowledgements around outbound calls.

Each spec names its connection. The rules, checked when a spec is built:

- a spec that lists role ``member`` uses the ``reader`` connection;
- a MUTATE or DRAFT spec uses the ``owner`` connection;
- a ``tool_name`` appears only on a READ spec on the ``reader`` connection;
- an ``owner_only`` spec lists role ``owner`` and no other.

A READ spec declares ``reader`` only when its handler selects from ``report_*`` views
alone. Nothing here can check that from the outside: the reader role's grants do, since
it can select from the report views and nothing else, so a ``reader`` spec that touches
a base table fails under the reader DSN in its own test.

Outbound pushes (Current, Telegram) are sink adapters, never registered operations.
