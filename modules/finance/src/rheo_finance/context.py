"""What an operation runs with: ``FinanceContext`` and ``UnitOfWork``.

Local stand-ins for rheoStream's ``rheo_contracts.WorkspaceContext`` and
``rheo_core.refs.resolver.UnitOfWork``, so moving the operations into rheoStream later
is a move, not a rewrite. ``operations.dispatch`` is the only code that opens a
connection; a handler gets the ``UnitOfWork`` dispatch opened and never ends its
transaction itself.
