"""The two sink report views, as SQLAlchemy selects that migration 0004 compiles.

``report_sink_spec`` is the derived ``sink_spec`` table without its ``computed_at``:
public text only (hosts, request templates, key file name, policy version, data
inputs), never a sender, key or identifier.

``report_sink`` has one row per sink that has a spec row or a sink decision. It reads
the newest ``sink_approve`` or ``sink_disable`` decision for the sink, reversed or not,
by the gate's own rule (``gate.SINK_DECISIONS`` and ``decision.reversed_clause``): only
an unreversed approval counts, and a reversed newest approval never falls back to an
older one. For that approval it shows ``approved_at`` and the approval's
``spec_digest``; both are null when there is none. ``stale`` is true when there is an
approval and its digest differs from the sink's ``sink_spec.spec_digest`` (a missing
spec row counts as differing), so the reader can tell a stale approval from views
alone. The ``enabled`` setting lives in a file, so the handler combines it.

Migration 0004 holds what these selects compiled to as frozen SQL. A guard test
compares ``view_sql`` of each select with the newest revision's frozen body, so a
change here or to ``reversed_clause`` fails until a new revision recreates the view.
The sink operation tests also compare the migrated view with the gate case by case, on
a database migrated fresh from the revisions.
