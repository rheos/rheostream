"""The sink gate (Key decision 7, FR-65): is a sink enabled right now?

A sink is enabled only when all three hold: the setting ``finance.sinks.<sink>.enabled``
is true; the newest ``sink_approve`` or ``sink_disable`` decision for it, reversed or
not, is an unreversed ``sink_approve``; and that approval's ``spec_digest`` equals the
digest of the sink's current spec, computed here in code from its provider on the
owner's unit of work. A hand-set setting with no approval, an approval with the setting
off, and an approval whose spec has changed since (stale) all read as disabled. A sink
with no provider is disabled.

Reversing the newest approval disables the sink, as a disable does: the gate does not
fall back to an older approval (``decision.effective`` would), so turning the sink on
again takes a fresh approval.

The setting is read from ``$FINANCE_DATA_DIR/settings.toml`` at each call, so a caller
cannot hand the gate a settings object of its own.

The errors below are what the socket owners (``rheo_finance.http``, the IMAP source)
raise before any socket. Their messages name the sink, never a key or header value.
