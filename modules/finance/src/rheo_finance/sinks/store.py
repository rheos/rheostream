"""The derived ``sink_spec`` table (derivation stage 16).

``write_sink_specs`` replaces every row with one per registered provider: the spec's
digest (the same ``spec_digest`` the gate computes) and its parts as public text, so a
reader-side view can tell a stale approval without running code. Derive calls it as its
last step, and ``finance.sink.approve`` calls it too, so ``report_sink`` is current
right after an approval. ``finance.sink.disable`` rewrites only its sink's row
(``write_sink_spec``), after the disable is recorded and in a savepoint, so a failing
provider can never undo a disable. ``computed_at`` is the database's
transaction time and is left out of the ledger digest.

``PROVIDER_MODULES`` lists every module that registers a provider (and its preview
builder) at import. This module imports them all, so derive and the sink operations,
which import it, always see every sink's spec. A module that registers one adds its
name here in the same change.
