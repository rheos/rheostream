"""The sink operations: ``finance.sink.state|preview|approve|disable`` (FR-65).

- ``state`` (READ, reader connection) reads ``report_sink`` and ``report_sink_spec``
  only, and adds the ``enabled`` setting from the settings file.
- ``preview`` (READ, owner connection) builds what the sink would send or request and
  its typed-list digest, and sends nothing. Current's exact pending membership may
  change with overdue priority; other sinks retain clock-free membership.
- ``approve`` (MUTATE, owner only) recomputes the preview and the spec in its own
  transaction and records a ``sink_approve`` decision only when the preview digest
  still starts with the typed prefix and the spec digest is still the one the preview
  showed. ``decision.record`` refuses that kind, so this module writes the row itself.
  ``cli.approve`` is its one caller, and it runs only in a terminal.
- ``disable`` (MUTATE, owner only) records ``sink_disable``; it needs no terminal.

Both writes also refresh the derived ``sink_spec`` table, so ``report_sink`` is
current right after them rather than after the next derive. A disable is recorded
first and refreshes only its sink's row, in a savepoint: a provider that fails cannot
roll the disable back (FR-65, disable at any time); the output says when the refresh
did not happen.

The enabled setting is read from ``$FINANCE_DATA_DIR/settings.toml`` at each call, as
the gate reads it, so what these report is what the gate sees. No operation here sets
it.
