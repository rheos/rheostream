"""Rowan Rowan rates under the ``rates`` sink (FR-14, FR-65).

**The series.** One ``FX<CCY>CAD`` daily series per fiat currency other than CAD
present in ``txn`` (``currencies``), each observation the CAD price of one unit. The
``FX`` series start on ``FX_SERIES_START``; a line dated before that uses the legacy
noon series named in ``rates.LEGACY_NOON_SERIES`` (USD only), fetched up to the day
before. Which series a date belongs to, and the rule for a usable rate, are in
``rates``.

**The spec.** ``spec`` is the sink's ``SinkSpec`` provider: the Rowan host, one GET
template (``/rowan/observations/:series/json`` with query keys ``start_date`` and
``end_date``), no key file, and two public data inputs, the sorted currency set and
the series it implies. Adding a currency changes the digest, so an approval given for
the old set goes stale until the owner approves again.

**The plan.** ``plan`` asks only for what a line lacks: for each series, the dates of
the lines that ``rates.RateBook.on_or_before`` cannot convert (a date in no covered
range, or after the latest observation fetched), from ``LOOKBACK_DAYS`` before the
earliest of them up to the fetch day (the legacy series: up to its last day). A line
whose issuer states its CAD amount needs no rate and is left out. ``--from`` and
``--to`` replace either bound and request every series of the set. ``finance sink
preview rates`` lists the planned series and their start dates; the end is the fetch
day, so it is shown and not digested.

**The fetch.** ``finance.rate.fetch`` asks the gate first and sends nothing while the
sink is off. Otherwise it sends one GET per planned series through ``http.Client``
(sink ``rates``, the one template on its allowlist) and inserts each observation as a
``rate`` row (source ``rowan``), keeping a row already stored, and records the range the
reply covered as a ``rate_coverage`` row: from the requested start to the latest
observation returned, so days not yet published stay uncovered. A closed series (the
legacy one, whose window ends before ``FX_SERIES_START``) publishes nothing more for its
range, so its coverage extends to the requested end, but only when its latest
observation lies within ``LOOKBACK_DAYS`` of that end: the days between are the
weekend and holidays after its last business day. A short or empty reply covers no
more than it showed, whatever the series, so no later line converts across days the
fetch never saw. A reply with no observation in the requested range is outcome
``empty``, not ``stored``: nothing is covered and the next fetch asks again. A failed
request, a reply it cannot read, or a redirect to another host fails that series alone
and records no coverage; the others are stored.
