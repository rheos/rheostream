"""Stored exchange rates (FR-14), the series each line's date belongs to, and the rule
that picks a rate for a line.

``rates.rowan`` fetches Rowan observations into ``rate`` and records each
range a fetch covered in ``rate_coverage``; derive stage 4 reads both. Both use
``RateBook.on_or_before``, so the fetch plans exactly the lines stage 4 cannot convert.

**The series.** A currency's ``FX<CCY>CAD`` series starts on ``FX_SERIES_START``; a
date before that belongs to the legacy noon series in ``LEGACY_NOON_SERIES`` (USD only),
and a currency without one has no series there. Coverage is per series, so a line on the
last legacy days needs only legacy coverage.

**The rule.** A line converts at the last stored observation on or before its date,
only when every day from that observation to the line's date lies inside the covered
ranges of the line's series (adjacent ranges join). So:

- a weekend or holiday line inside a covered range converts at the business day before
  it: the covered days between published nothing;
- a line dated after the latest observation a fetch returned stays unconverted until a
  later fetch covers its date;
- a line in a gap between two fetched ranges stays unconverted, and the fetch plans it:
  a gap is always fetched, never bridged by an older rate.
