"""The account registry from ``accounts.csv`` and ``account_identifiers.csv`` (FR-1).

``AccountRow`` and ``AccountIdentifierRow`` validate one row each. ``build_registry``
then applies the rules that span rows and files, and records every failure on every row
involved:

- a slug used by two account rows, or the built-in account's slug;
- an identifier row naming no loaded account (the ``account`` column holds a slug);
- one identifier (same kind, same text) on two rows;
- two last-four identifiers (``LAST_FOUR_KINDS``: ``number`` and ``masked_card``) of
  different accounts at one institution that end in the same four digits, the
  institution compared by ``institution_key`` (casefolded, whitespace collapsed,
  otherwise exact), unless both are distinct full numbers (``full_number``): the reused
  Alder parser matches an account on its last four only (Key decision 1), and the
  Alder adapter matches with these same two functions. A masked or last-four-only
  identifier on either side is what a last-four match could confuse, so that pair is
  refused, and with it every row of every account ending in those four digits there
  (refusing only the pair could leave one account to take the others' statements).
  Two distinct full numbers are told apart by a parser that matches the whole number
  (a statement may print one per section, and two sections may end alike); a last-four
  match that finds both is ``ambiguous_account``, never a pick. ADR-0011;
- a slug or label that the adopted-path check (``path_check.PathCheck``) refuses: a
  run of 8 or more digits that is not a date, or a registered identifier. The report
  views show both, so neither may carry one;
- an account left with no identifier row (AC-1), checked after the rules above.

An account of kind ``bill_vendor`` is one running bill account with a vendor: each
bill's total holds the unpaid balance before it, so only the newest is owed (ADR-0013).
A vendor whose invoices stand alone is a payee, not an account.

The built-in account "Paid outside recorded accounts" (kind ``wallet``, identifier
``CASH`` of kind ``internal``) is added here, never read from a file, so it exists
after every load. Kind ``internal`` is reserved for it.

Adding an account is data entry alone: a row in each file, no code change.
