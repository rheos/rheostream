"""Issuer description patterns: what a line's wording says it is (FR-15, FR-15(a),
FR-15(c); SPEC Derivation stage 9).

``classify(description_norm, *, account_kind, issuer)`` reads the wording of one line
against ``patterns.json`` and returns its ``Hints``. Every parser that sets the hint
columns of ``document_line`` calls it with the line's ``description_norm``, its
account's kind and its document's issuer key; a parser never passes ``hint_rows``, so
a line's parse output depends on the repo's patterns only, never on manual hint rows.

How a wording matches: as a whole-token run of the normalized text, so ``return`` does
not match inside ``returns`` and ``nsf`` not inside ``transfer``. An entry matches when
every part of its ``all`` list matches, no part of its ``unless`` list does, and the
line's issuer and account kind are in its ``issuers`` and ``account_kinds`` (when it
names them). In each section the first matching entry in file order wins.

The fields:

- ``transfer_hint``: the transfer kind (``card_payment``, ``hazel_preauthorized``,
  ``juniper_payout``; ``manual_out`` or ``manual_in`` for a ``transfer_hints.csv``
  row). A bill payment to a vendor names no own account and gets none: it is spending.
- ``hint_account_slug``: the counterpart the wording names. For a built-in pattern it
  is an issuer key of the archive's issuer map (``documents.issuers.ISSUER_DIRS``),
  which stage 9 resolves to the registered account(s) of that issuer; for a
  ``manual_*`` hint it is the owner's own account slug from the row.
- ``reversal_hint``: ``out`` when the wording says the owner's own payment was
  cancelled (the reversal is a credit), ``in`` when a received payment was clawed back
  (the reversal is a debit). Stage 8 pairs by the line's sign, so the direction is the
  wording's claim, never what pairing relies on. A wording that names no direction
  ("reversed", "returned") has direction ``sign`` in the file: ``credit`` settles it as
  a ``reversal`` row's does (a credit is ``out``, a debit ``in``), and with ``credit``
  None it sets nothing.
- ``conversion_hint``: the wording says one balance was converted into another
  currency on the same account.
- ``etransfer_hint`` and ``etransfer_name_position``: the e-Transfer wording matched,
  and where the name it introduces sits: ``after`` (the text after the wording) or
  ``parenthesized`` (the first parenthesized group after it); None when the wording
  prints no name. ``etransfer_name`` reads that text.
- ``fee_type``: the kind of fee the wording names.

``hint_rows`` (from ``manual.transfer_hints``) are consulted after the built-in
patterns, in file order, and only fill what the built-ins left empty: an ``out`` or
``in`` row sets ``transfer_hint`` and its counterpart, a ``conversion`` row sets
``conversion_hint``, and a ``reversal`` row sets ``reversal_hint`` from ``credit``
(the line's sign, which the row does not carry), so with ``credit`` None a reversal
row sets nothing.
