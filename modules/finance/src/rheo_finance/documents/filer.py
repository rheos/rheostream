"""The Downloads filer, the first step of ``finance.document.file`` (FR-2, Key
decision 2).

It looks at the regular, non-hidden files directly under ``finance.paths.downloads``
and writes nothing there: it opens a file there for reading only, and never deletes,
moves or renames one. Each file it looks at ends one of these ways:

- **Monitor file.** A file the existing monitors watch for (``MONITOR_PATTERNS``,
  invented names; the owner's identities file gives his monitors' own patterns through
  ``identities.layout``) belongs to them, which file them so their tickets still fire;
  the ledger adopts them from the archive. The filer never opens one. One whose mtime is
  at least ``MONITOR_WAIT`` old is counted as waiting (status line 10).
- **Filed.** The file goes to every registered parser that reads its format and has a
  ``filing_date``, in parser id order, and the first that reads a date names the copy
  ``<issuer-dir>/<YYYY-MM-DD>.<ext>`` (the statement's period end or the bill's date),
  or ``<YYYY-MM-DD>-2.<ext>``, ``-3`` and so on when that name holds other bytes
  (SPEC "Files, paths and settings" > Archive). A filed name is built from the date
  alone: nothing of the downloaded file's own name, which is free text, reaches it.
  The copy holds exactly the bytes that were hashed.
- **Known.** Bytes already registered in ``document``, already at the name the date
  gives, or met earlier in the same scan are not copied again, so filing the same
  bytes twice adds nothing.
- **Refused.** The adopted-path check (``path_check.PathCheck``) runs on the
  archive-relative name before the copy. A name it refuses (the date's digits make a
  registered identifier) is not written, and the file stays where it is.
- **Unrecognised.** A file of a format some filing rule reads (pdf, csv) that no rule
  dates, including a PDF with no text layer, stays where it is. A file of any other
  format is not a candidate and is passed over.
- **Unreadable.** A file that vanished or cannot be read mid-scan is counted.

Refused and unrecognised files are listed by their name in Downloads in the returned
``DownloadsFiled``, for an in-process caller only: the operation's output carries
counts, and no Downloads name goes into a table, an event or an error message.
