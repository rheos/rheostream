"""The archive walk and the document registry, and ``finance.document.file`` (FR-2).

The operation runs the Downloads filer (``documents.filer``) first and then the walk,
so a file it copies in is registered by the same run.

The identifiers the check refuses come from the manual identifiers file itself and
from ``account_identifier``, so the walk never depends on derivation stage 2 having
run first (a rebuild registers files before stage 2 loads the registry). The file is
read failing closed: one whose rows cannot all be trusted (a header that is not the
expected one, a row that is not valid CSV, a cell holding a line break) refuses the
whole walk, because an identifier the read lost would let a path carrying it be
stored.

The walk adopts the files under ``finance.paths.archive`` where they sit: it opens
each one for reading only, to hash it, and never moves, renames or writes one. Every
file it meets is skipped, registered or known, and every walk then rechecks the paths
already stored, withholding any it now refuses.

- **Skipped and counted.** The adopted-path check (``PathCheck``) runs on the
  archive-relative path before anything else: a path carrying a registered account
  identifier, or a run of 8 or more digits that is not a ``YYYYMMDD`` date, is not
  registered. Neither is a symlink or anything else that is not a regular file, a file
  outside every mapped directory (``issuers.ISSUER_DIRS``), an iCloud placeholder
  whose bytes are not on disk, or a file or directory that vanished or cannot be read
  mid-walk. Each lands in ``archive_skip`` as a count by issuer
  directory and reason, and its path is kept nowhere: not in a table, the output, an
  event or an error message.
- **Registered.** A ``document`` row keyed by the file's sha256, status ``filed``, or
  kind ``image`` and status ``needs_manual_entry`` for a photo (FR-9). A drop record is
  extraction ``transcription``; everything else ``none`` until a parser runs.
- **Known.** Bytes already registered are a no-op, so filing the same bytes twice
  leaves the count unchanged. When the same bytes sit at two paths, the first path in
  sorted order is the document's. A registered document whose bytes now sit only at
  another path follows them: its path and issuer are updated. A document whose bytes
  are gone from the archive keeps its row.
- **Withheld.** Every stored path is checked again on every walk. One the check now
  refuses (an identifier registered after the file was filed) is replaced by
  ``WITHHELD_PATH`` and counted in the output; the file is counted in ``archive_skip``
  like any other skipped file, and the document gets its path back once the owner
  renames the file.

Hidden files and directories (a leading ``.``, such as ``.DS_Store``) are not
documents and are passed over, except the iCloud placeholders counted above.

``archive_skip`` is rewritten on every walk; ``document`` only ever gains rows.
