"""``obligation`` (derived, stage 14), the bill date on ``statement_period``, and the
duplicate bill months in ``report_status`` (FR-19, FR-21; SPEC "Data Models",
Derivation stage 14, status line 9).

``obligation`` is keyed by a derived id of its natural key (payee, kind, period label),
and that key is unique too. ``amount_due`` and ``threshold_due`` are as printed, so a
card in credit holds a negative figure; ``remaining`` and ``threshold_remaining`` never
go below zero. ``manual_mismatch`` and ``payments_mismatch`` each hold a difference in
CAD. ``supersedes_id`` is on the newer row and names the row it replaced. The payee key
is deferred to commit, as ``payee``'s account key is: stage 2 rewrites ``payee`` in the
same transaction. The key to ``supersedes_id`` is deferred so a stage may insert a chain
in any order.

``statement_period.bill_date`` is the date a bill prints, which a document's period
does not hold. The bill parsers' versions moved with it, so a stored parse of a bill
is redone on the next derive.

``VIEWS`` is frozen SQL (see 0014). ``report_status`` keeps its columns and its grant,
and gains the fact ``duplicate_bill_month``: per payee, its bills whose period label
carries a ``-<n>`` suffix.

No reader grant on the table: report views grant SELECT in their own revisions.
