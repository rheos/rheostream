"""The coverage matrix (derivation stage 6) and the accounts of rejected documents.

``coverage`` holds one row per account and calendar month from the account's first
known date: its state and, for some ``missing`` and ``partial`` months, a reason code.
The primary key is the "exactly one state per account-month" rule. ``month`` is the
first day of the month. A reason belongs to a state: ``export_period`` and
``mail_window`` explain a ``partial`` month, ``no_raw_mail`` and ``mail_purged`` a
``missing`` one, and ``running_balance_break`` either (a month wholly inside a balance
jump is missing, a month the jump only reaches into is partial). The mail reasons are
filled by the mail intake stage; nothing writes them yet.

``rejected_period`` is parse cache, written with the rejection: for each registered
account a rejected document names, the period it states there. A rejected document
loads no period and no line, so without it coverage could not tell which account's
months to show as ``rejected``. A rejection that names no registered account (an
unknown or ambiguous one) has no row.

``txn.tax_year`` already exists, generated from ``recognition_date`` (0010); stage 5
fills ``recognition_date``.

The prompt numbered this revision 0009; 0009 to 0011 were taken, so it is 0012. Both
tables are derived and rebuilt by every derive; the account keys are deferred to
commit, as in the parse cache. No reader grant: report views grant SELECT in their
own revisions.
