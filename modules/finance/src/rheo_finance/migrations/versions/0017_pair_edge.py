"""``pair_edge``: the one candidate graph of lines that belong together (Key decision
9, SPEC "Data Models").

One row per candidate edge, applied or not, rebuilt by every derive (derived, stage 8
for ``reversal`` edges, stage 9 and the peer-money stages for the other kinds). ``id``
is derived from the kind and the endpoints. ``a_txn_id`` and ``b_txn_id`` are the two
lines (for a loan edge ``a_txn_id`` is the loan's out withdrawal, null for a manual loan
with no out line; ``b_txn_id`` is null for ``own_one_sided``), ``loan_key`` a loan
edge's loan, ``b_part_id`` an allocation part, ``b_account_id`` the registered account
of an ``own_one_sided`` destination, ``group_id`` a group of edges decided together,
``applied`` whether the edge is in force, ``basis_ref`` the decision that applied or
refused it, ``fee_txn_id`` the fee line of a pair (the derived one, or a conversion's
fee line as its issuer printed it) and ``spread_cad`` a conversion's spread in CAD
(restricted).

A ``reversal`` edge joins two distinct lines: ``a_txn_id`` the reversal line,
``b_txn_id`` the earlier line it undoes. No reader grant: report views grant SELECT in
their own revisions.
