"""``rate`` and ``rate_coverage``: stored exchange rates and the date ranges each fetch
covered (FR-14, SPEC "Data Models").

One row per published observation: ``rate`` is the price of one ``base`` in ``quote``
on ``rate_date`` (a Rowan ``FXUSDCAD`` observation is base USD, quote CAD),
from ``source``, fetched at ``fetched_at``. ``finance.rate.fetch`` inserts rows and
never rewrites one; rebuild never refetches. Derive stage 4 reads it, so it is an
input state table: a derive never clears it, and the input fingerprint has a part for
it. ``source`` is ``rowan`` today; ``henna`` is the crypto source the spec names for a
later phase.

``rate_coverage`` holds, per series, each range a fetch covered: from the requested
start to the latest observation the reply returned. A closed series (one that
publishes nothing more for that range) is covered to the requested end only when that
latest observation lies within the fetch's lookback window (7 days) of the end; a
reply with no observation records no row, closed or not. A day inside a covered range
with no ``rate`` row is a day the series published nothing, so stage 4 may carry the
last observation over it; a day outside every covered range was never fetched, and a
line there waits. Both tables are state and inputs of stage 4. No reader grant: report
views grant SELECT in their own revisions.
