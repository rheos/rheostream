"""What every crypto parser shares: a withdrawal as its lines (FR-4, FR-15(b); SPEC
Derivation stage 1 "Crypto quantities and fees", edge case 48).

A withdrawal line's quantity is what left the account for the destination, net of any
network or withdrawal fee; the fee is its own ``crypto_fee`` line on the same account,
``occurred_at`` and TXID, so the account's balance moves by both and the destination's
deposit pairs with the net quantity. A source prints its figure either gross (the fee
included) or net, and says which; ``withdrawal_lines`` turns either into the two lines.

When a source states no fee at all, the withdrawal is one line carrying the one figure
the source prints, with ``fee_stated`` false: pairing then allows
``finance.crypto.fee_tolerance_pct`` between it and the deposit. A stated fee of zero
is a stated fee: one line, ``fee_stated`` true, and no fee line.
