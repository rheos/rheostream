"""What the fiat CSV exports with a balance column share (FR-12(a), FR-3
``running_balance``): an exact header, signed amounts, and lines checked per currency
against the balance each row prints.

- ``rows`` reads the file as a table whose header must be exactly the parser's
  columns (cells compared without surrounding spaces); any other header, a row of
  another width, or a CSV the reader cannot read is ``NotRecognised``.
- ``Movement`` is one row as the lines it gives (a principal line and, when the row
  states a fee, a fee line) with the balance the row ends on, fee included.
- ``running_balance_result`` puts each currency's movements oldest first, stores the
  printed balance on each row's last line, and splits the rows into verified segments
  and gaps (``base.balance_runs``, one entry per row). Each currency is one
  ``statement_period`` from its first line's date to its last's, tied out when its
  rows form one segment with no gap, so a currency of one row never ties out. The
  file's own date range proves nothing: an export can be a filtered selection.
