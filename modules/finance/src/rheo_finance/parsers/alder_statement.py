"""The Alder monthly statement (PDF), through ``docextract`` (FR-7, Key decision 1).

docextract reads the layout and checks every account against the statement's summary
box; this module only maps its result onto the ledger:

- a non-empty ``checks`` list rejects the whole document (``checks_failed``);
- each account section becomes one CAD ``statement_period`` with control kind
  ``summary``, matched to the registry by its ``ref`` (the account number's last four
  digits) against the identifiers of this institution, never by the printed name: an
  account renamed on later statements keeps its number and its match. An account
  the registry does not hold rejects the document (``unknown_account``); two
  registered accounts for one ref, or two sections for one account, reject it as
  ``ambiguous_account``;
- each transaction becomes a line with its running balance and ``fee_type``. A line
  holding both a withdrawal and a deposit becomes two lines, the withdrawal first; a
  line moving no money (a notice) is a ``notice_fact`` with no amount;
- the overdrawn spells docextract reports ride on the period;
- every line carries the hints its wording gives (``parsers.hints.with_hints``), and
  a bill payment or automatic payment keeps the payee it prints in parentheses
  as its restricted ``counterparty`` (an e-Transfer's name comes from ``with_hints``).

Accounts are matched where ``accounts.csv`` gives the institution as ``INSTITUTION``,
compared by ``institution_key`` (case and spacing aside).
