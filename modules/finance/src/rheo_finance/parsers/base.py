"""What a parser takes and returns (FR-3), shared by the registry, the docextract
adapter and every parser.

A parser is a function ``(text, accounts) -> ParseResult``. It reads extracted text,
never a path, and matches the accounts the document names through ``AccountLookup``.
A ``running_balance`` parser splits its lines into verified segments and the gaps
between them with ``balance_runs``, which coverage can run again over stored lines.
It raises ``NotRecognised`` when the text is not a layout it reads (the document is
``unparsed``) and ``Rejected`` when it read the layout but the document must not load
(``unknown_account``, a failed check). The registry checks a ``summary`` control
itself; a parser does not need to.
