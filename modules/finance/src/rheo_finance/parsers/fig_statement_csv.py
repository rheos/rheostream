"""The Fig statement CSV (FR-12(a), FR-3, FR-4, FR-15(c); SPEC "Derivation" stage 1,
"Fiat CSV exports").

``COLUMNS`` is the parser's own, invented layout, the one the synthetic fixture
prints: a header row, then one row per transaction of one or more balances, each with
its kind, a date, a signed change of balance with its fees included, the fees as a
positive figure, the balance after the row, one counterpart, and for a row that
crosses currencies the other currency and the sum in it. The owner's identities file
gives the header his own exports print and how a row's kind is read there
(``identities.layout`` and ``identities.real``); a name may be split over two columns
there (``balance_csv.variants``): the counterpart as the one for money out and the one
for money in, the other currency as the one the money left and the one it went to. A
file whose header is not exactly the expected one is ``NotRecognised`` (``unparsed``,
no line).

**Control kind: ``running_balance``, per currency** (``parsers.balance_csv``). Unlike
the transaction history PDF, the export prints a balance, so its lines are verified
where the balances continue, and the document counts as ``official``.

The lines are the history PDF's (``parsers.fig_history``), so stage 3 pairs the two
one to one when they overlap: the matcher's key is account, currency, signed amount
and a date inside the tolerance, and each row gives

- a principal line of the amount less the fee (for money out, what left net of the
  fee; a card or transfer paid in another currency keeps that amount, signed, as
  ``original_amount``), and
- a fee line of the fee, negative, when it is not zero: ``fee_type``
  ``conversion_fee`` when the row exchanges between two currencies, else ``fee``.

A conversion is a row in each balance: the out-leg carries the fee, the in-leg is
what arrived, so the fee line is the
conversion's only one, as on the PDF. A row that moves nothing (a card check) gives
no line.

The description is the export's own, and carries the hints from
``reference.patterns.classify`` (account kind ``wallet``) on every line but the fee
lines. A transfer's counterpart is its restricted ``counterparty``; a card merchant is
not a counterparty.

The export prints no account identifier, so the account is the one ``wallet`` account
with a ``number`` identifier registered at ``INSTITUTION`` over the file's dates
(``AccountLookup.by_institution``, which names the residual risk): none is
``unknown_account``, several are ``ambiguous_account``. Negative fees are not this
layout.
