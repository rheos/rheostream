"""What the credit card parsers share (FR-8, FR-19, FR-20).

Sign convention. A card line is signed from the owner's side, as every other
account's: a purchase, a fee or interest is negative, a payment or a refund positive.
So a card statement's ``opening`` and ``closing`` are the balance owed, negated (a
card owing 100.00 has balance -100.00), and its lines sum from one to the other. The
card fields stay as printed: ``balance_due`` is the statement balance owed,
``minimum_due`` the printed minimum (None when the statement prints none),
``total_payments`` the payments the statement reports, all positive. A card
statement's date is its period end.

A card is matched to the registry by the last four digits of its masked number at the
card's institution (``AccountLookup.by_last_four``: identifiers of kinds ``number``
and ``masked_card``), never by the cardholder's printed name, which no card parser
stores. The loader refuses the last-four match for an (institution, last four) group
unless every cross-account pair in it is two distinct full numbers (ADR-0011), and a
match that still finds two accounts is ``ambiguous_account``.
