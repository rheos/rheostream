"""A patient receipt (PDF) from a clinic, filed under ``receipts/`` (FR-8, FR-10).

Registered for the ``receipts`` directory, so it reads the files of every
sub-directory there (``parsers.registry.parsers_for``); any other receipt layout stays
``unparsed``. The invented layout, as the synthetic fixture prints it:

- the first line is ``<clinic>   Visit Slip``: the clinic is the payee;
- ``Slip printed:   <dd>-<Mon>-<yyyy>`` among the clinic's address lines;
- a payment table under its header line: every line until the paid total is one
  payment, ``<dd>-<Mon>-<yy>   <type>   [<description>]   $<amount>``;
- ``Slip paid total   $<amount>``. What follows (the balance, the treatment table) is
  read past and stored nowhere. The labels are read through ``identities.real``.

What it gives: one ``receipt`` line per payment and no ``statement_period``, control
``none``. A line has no account (a receipt is evidence of a payment, matched to a
payment line in stage 3), ``posting_date`` the payment date, ``amount`` the payment
signed as the owner's outflow (negative), ``currency`` CAD (the receipt prints
dollars and no other currency), ``description_raw`` ``Patient receipt: <payment
type>`` and ``counterparty`` (restricted) the clinic normalized as descriptions are
(``text.normalize_description``). The patient's name and address, the payment
descriptions and the treatment lines are stored nowhere.

A payment's description prints the payment's own number (``Payment #<number>``). The
line stores ``payment_ref_digest`` (restricted), the first 16 hex digits of a sha256
over it, never the number: stage 3 keys a receipt line by it, so two genuine receipts
that print the same date, amount and type stay two, while a re-saved copy of one
receipt gives the same keys. A payment whose description prints no number has none.

The check: the payments sum to the paid total, else the receipt is rejected
(``checks_failed``) with zero lines.
