"""The Olive monthly statement (PDF), two layout versions (FR-3 ``summary``, FR-8,
FR-15(a)).

Two versions of one invented template, told apart by their title line (``NEWER``,
``olive.statement.newer``). Each version reads only its own, so the two register
separately and the document records which one read it. Labels are compared with their
spaces removed (``parsers.text.squeezed``), however the text extractor spaced them. The
labels below (the title, the date label, the section headings, the account label, the
opening line, the totals line, the page-break marker) are the synthetic fixture's
invented ones; the owner's identities file gives his own (``identities.real``).

The layout: a header with the statement date (the period end), then one section
per account under a heading (``HEADINGS``; a section that runs onto the next page
repeats its heading and its account line). Each section prints its
account number, an opening line dated the period start, transaction lines ``DD Mon
YY  <description>  <amount>  <balance>`` whose description may wrap onto indented
lines, and closes with a totals line ``<label> $<withdrawals> $<deposits>``.

Wrapped descriptions. The text comes through ``docextract`` compacted (every run of
four or more spaces becomes three), so a wrapped line, a page footer and a header
all start with the same three spaces and the description column cannot be read from
the indentation. A wrap is told by its place and shape instead: indented lines right
after a transaction line, made only of name characters (letters, spaces, ``&``,
apostrophes and hyphens: no digit and no dot, so neither a page number nor a web
address is name-shaped), and followed by the next dated line or the page-break
marker. Any other indented text right after a transaction line (a footer, a URL, a
number) is a layout this parser has not seen, and the statement is
``NotRecognised``: it never joins a description. A footer made only of name
characters is stopped by its place alone: it joins nothing unless the next dated
line or the marker follows it.

Headings. Every account line needs a heading of its own above it (a continued
section repeats its heading), and a heading-shaped line (capitals at the start of a
line, spaces allowed) that is not one of ``HEADINGS`` is ``NotRecognised``, so an
account never takes the kind of the section before it, and a section in another
currency is never read as CAD.

- Each account gives one CAD ``statement_period``, control ``summary``: opening, the
  last balance as closing, and the printed totals. The registry ties it out.
- A line prints one unsigned amount; its side is read from the running balance (the
  balance before it less the amount, a withdrawal, or plus it, a deposit). A line the
  balance does not continue either way rejects the statement (``checks_failed``); the
  printed totals then check every side the balance chain chose.
- An account is matched by its full number among the registry's ``number``
  identifiers at ``INSTITUTION``; the number is stored nowhere. An unregistered
  number rejects the statement (``unknown_account``), two accounts holding it
  ``ambiguous_account``.
- Every line carries the hints its wording gives (``parsers.hints.with_hints``): an
  e-Transfer's named counterpart becomes its restricted ``counterparty``, and a
  cancelled e-Transfer its ``reversal_hint``.

Text that is not this layout (no title, no statement date, a section heading or a
dated line it cannot read, a section without its opening or totals) is
``NotRecognised``.
